        name: 'Origin of philosophical thought in Ancient Babylon and Egypt',
        description: `<p>Ancient Babylon and Egypt were slave states. Slave labour was used to build irrigation installations, pyramids, temples and palaces. By the end of IV or beginning of III millennium BC the development of slave-owning relations in these countries had reached its peak.</p>

        <p>Origin of philosophical thought in Ancient Babylon and Egypt was closely connected to the first steps of science about the world - astronomy, cosmology, and mathematics, on the one hand, and to mythology, on the other. Philosophy had not yet emerged as a distinct form of social consciousness. The developing economy of the ancient world required the expansion of knowledge and its application in life. Economic needs demanded the establishment of an accurately calculated calendar, based on astronomical observations of the movements of the moon, sun and stars. All this led to the development of scientific knowledge. Babylonian mathematicians laid the foundation for algebra and geometry, mastered the method of approximate extraction of square roots, solving square equations. The Babylonians invented the sixty-digit &quot;positional system&quot; of written calculus. From this system comes modern timekeeping (1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds).</p>

        <p>The Babylonian world view, like that of the other peoples of the ancient East, was inseparable from mythology, the first attempt to make sense of observed phenomena in nature. A big role was played here by the priesthood, which imposed religious beliefs. Mythical tales of the origins of the gods (&quot;theogony&quot;) evolved into beliefs about the origins of the world (&quot;cosmogony&quot;). The luminaries were seen not only as a means for calculating time and astronomical predictions, but also as creators of the world and as forces constantly acting upon it. The Babylonians regarded the Moon as the principal luminary, the &quot;father of the gods&quot;. The stars were deities who only shone at night. The Sun was the power extinguishing the shine of the heavenly bodies, therefore it was the source of darkness, the power of the underworld and brought death. The moon, dying, is resurrected to new life, so it is the source of eternal, ineradicable life. The ancient myth of creation portrays the struggle of good and evil as the triumph of light over darkness. The God of light is celebrated as the mighty moral force ruling the world. The &quot;stellar&quot; (&quot;astral&quot;) worldview led to the development of astrology - a fantastic belief in the ability of the luminaries to directly influence the fate of entire societies and individuals.</p>

        <p>With the development of slavery and the aggravation of social relations in Babylon, works appeared that not only broke with mythology, but also contained the rudiments of atheistic thought. The most prominent literary monument of this kind is the Dialogue between a master and a slave &quot;about the meaning of life&quot;. It criticises religious dogma, suggests that it is absurd to follow the dictates of religion, to offer sacrifice to the gods, and to hope for a reward in the afterlife.</p>

        <p>Ancient Egyptian culture, one of the oldest in the world, emerged at the end of the fourth millennium B.C., the period of the formation of the slave system. The ancient Egyptian economy was based on irrigation agriculture and stock breeding. In this connection building arts, stone and pottery crafts, as well as sciences that served the developing economy - astronomy, arithmetic and geometry - reached considerable development. The establishment of the solar calendar was of great practical importance. According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, in ancient Egypt the duration of a year of 365 days was determined earlier than in other nations. The highest achievement of the Egyptian geometry was calculation of the ratio of circumference to diameter (I number), the exact formula for calculation of the volume of the truncated pyramid with a square foundation, areas of triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles. In Egyptian schools for calculations the special method which assumes presence of certain theoretical knowledge was applied.</p>

        <p>In development of ancient Egyptian thought it is possible to trace the way leading from religion to philosophical interpretation of myths. Over time, the myths were given a philosophical rather than religious meaning, which they did not have originally. This is explained not only by rise of scientific knowledge, but mainly by strengthening of struggles between slaves and slave-owners, between wealthy strata of free people who by II millennium B.C. were out of the general population and old slave-owning nobility.</p>

        <p>Works appear in which the truth of religious belief in &quot;eternal life in the other world&quot; is questioned. In contrast to the views of the old slave-owning nobility, with its disdain for work and preaching of the other world, these works talk about the possibility of life in this world. For example, the Harper&#39;s Song, a classic work of ancient Egyptian literature, asserted that no one of the dead comes to tell about the afterlife. Nor can the human mind and senses say anything about it. Consequently, it said, there is no reason to believe the tales of the existence of any other world than the earthly one. The great significance of this monument in the history of human thought lies precisely in the fact that in it for the first time with great directness and logical force sounded the call: instead of relying on the afterlife, it is necessary to arrange &quot;their affairs on earth.</p>

        <p>Another, later literary monument criticises the religious doctrine of the immortality of the soul. It says that after death &quot;man disappears and his body turns to mud&quot;. Those who wish to perpetuate their name should not rely on dreams of an afterlife, but on their earthly deeds. The ancient Egyptian papyrus &quot;Conversation of a Disillusioned Man with his Spirit&quot; expresses doubts about the justice of the existing order in which &quot;violence&quot; reigns, &quot;robbers everywhere&quot;, &quot;hearts are cruel and every man takes his brother&#39;s things&quot;.</p>

        <p>Sharp social conflicts, often taking the form of rebellions against the rule of the pharaohs and slave-holding nobility, also gave rise to the first political teachings expressing the ideas of the ruling classes. Thus, one of these sermons openly states: &quot;Bend the crowd. Destroy the fervour that comes from it. In these teachings, imbued with a deep hatred of the masses, the political system of the slave owners is presented as an eternal order, established by God, and is not subject to any change. A brief review of the history of the origin of philosophical thought in ancient Babylon and Egypt shows the presence of the first rudiments of philosophical and social thought among the peoples of the Ancient East. In ancient Egyptian monuments the question about the material origin of natural phenomena is already raised in the naive form. Here it is mentioned about the cool water as a source of all living beings, and also about the air filling the space and &quot;abiding in all things&quot;. In ancient Babylon and Egypt, however, philosophical thought had not reached the level typical of more developed slave-holding countries. Nevertheless, the beginnings of spontaneously materialistic and atheistic views of the Egyptians and Babylonians had some influence on the further development of science and materialistic thought in the ancient world. According to Plutarch, the ancient Greek philosopher Thales borrowed from the Egyptians the idea of water as the first cause and beginning of all things.</p>

        <p>The various schools of philosophy emerged from different perspectives on timeless questions of existence. Each founder of its teachings, trying to prove the validity of their world view, surrounded himself by students and followers who supported and developed the philosophy of that particular school. At times, the teachings of different schools literally contradicted each other, but based on the laws of the same philosophy and logic, each point of view had the right to exist.</p>

        <p>The time around 500 BC (800 to 200 BC). - is a unique time in world history. The German philosopher C. Jaspers (1883-1969) describes it as an &quot;axial time&quot;. &quot;At this time many extraordinary things happen. Confucius and Lao Tzu lived in China at that time and all branches of Chinese philosophy emerged. In India the Upanishads arose, the Buddha lived...; in Iran Zarathustra taught of a world of struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Deuteronomy, spoke; in Greece it is the time of Homer, the philosophers Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Thucydides and Archimedes. Everything associated with these names arose almost simultaneously within a few centuries in China, India and the West independently of each other.&quot; This era developed the basic categories by which we still think today, laying the foundations of the world&#39;s religions, which remain the most influential today. It was at this time that man became aware of his being as a whole, of himself as a being, not closed, but universal. The changes that came at the &quot;Axial Time&quot; were of tremendous significance for subsequent development. &quot;It was then that the most abrupt turn in history took place. Man of the type that has survived to this day has emerged&quot;, concludes Jaspers.</p>

        name: "Philosophy of ancient India",
        description: `<p>There are several periods in the history of Indian philosophy, which are rather tentative in themselves. Let us dwell, first of all, on the main of them, which laid the foundation of the whole Indian philosophy and which constituted the philosophical classics of Indian thought and its entire culture, namely the Vedic and Epic periods.</p>

        <p><strong>The philosophy of the Vedic period.</strong> The main source of information on this period is an extensive body of literary texts that have a common name of the Vedas (literally &quot;vedas&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;) written in the ancient Indian language Sanskrit (so called Vedic Sanskrit).</p>

        <p>The Vedas consist of four collections of hymns (samhitas), chants, magical incantations, prayers, etc.: the Rigveda, the Samaveda, the Yajurveda and the Atharvaveda (or Atharvangirasa). Each of these compilations (usually known as the Vedas proper) over time became outfitted with various commentaries and additions of ritual, magical and philosophical nature - the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads. Actually philosophical views of ancient India got the most complete reflection in Upanishads.</p>

        <p>All the Vedic texts are considered holy books, divine revelation like the Bible, though in their main points they had formed probably by the middle of the first millennium B.C. The Brahmans were considered the true experts and interpreters of Vedas.</p>

        <p><strong>The philosophy of the Upanishads.</strong> Originally the Upanishads meant sitting around a teacher for the purpose of learning the truth. Then the term came to mean secret teachings. The Upanishads developed the themes of the Vedas: the idea of unity of all things, cosmological themes, the search for cause and effect relationships of phenomena, etc.&nbsp; For example, questions such as: &quot;Where is the sun at night?&quot;, &quot;Where do the stars disappear during the day?&quot; etc. But unlike previous texts, the Upanishads focus not on the outer, but on the inner side of being and phenomena. The main focus is on man, his cognition and above all moral perfection. &quot;Who are we?&quot;, &quot;Where do we come from?&quot;, &quot;Where are we going?&quot; - These are the questions of the Upanishads.</p>

        <p>As the ultimate foundation of existence in the Upanishads is Brahman, the universal, impersonal soul of the world, the spirit from which the whole world with all its elements comes into being. This universality of Brahman is achieved through Brahman&#39;s knowledge of himself. Brahman is identical with, and at the same time opposed to, the atman - the individual soul, the subjective spiritual element, the &#39;I&#39;.</p>

        <p>At the same time, brahman and atman are identical, brahman in the individual becomes aware of himself and thereby passes into and becomes atman. In turn, at the highest level of the intuitive self, when the subject and the object are merged, the atman merges with the brahman. Thus we have before us a model of dialectical thinking, in particular the affirmation of the identity of the opposites: brahman as the supreme objective beginning and atman as the subjective spiritual beginning. The idea of the identity of brahman and atman, object and subject, world soul and individual soul also means the possibility of their mutual transition.</p>

        <p>The doctrine of Brahman and atman is the central point of the Upanishads which asserts the identity of the being of the individual with the universal essence of the world. Related to this is the doctrine of samsara (cycle of life) and karma (law of retribution) in the Upanishads. In the doctrine of samsara, human life is understood as a certain form of endless rebirth. And the future birth of an individual is determined by the law of karma. The future of a person is the result of the deeds and actions one performs in the preceding life. Only those who have led a respectable life can expect to be born in the future life as a representative of a higher varna (class): Brahman (priest), kshatriya (warrior or representative of power) or vaishya (farmer, craftsman or merchant). Those who have led an unrighteous way of life are destined for the fate of a member of a lower varna - a shudra (commoner) or worse: his atman may get into the body of an animal.</p>

        <p>Therefore, the most important task of man and the main category of the Upanishads is his liberation (moksha) from the &quot;world of objects and passions&quot; and his constant moral perfection. This liberation is realised through the dissolution of the atman in Brahman, the realisation of the identity of one&#39;s individual soul with the world soul. Thus, in the Upanishad philosophy, every person is a &#39;smith&#39; of his own happiness and his whole destiny depends on his own conduct.</p>

        <p>As already mentioned, cognition and self-knowledge is one of the most important themes and problems of the Upanishads. But it is not primarily a question of sensual or even rational cognition. Genuine, most true cognition consists in the deepest and most complete union and realization of the identity of atman and brahman. And only he who is able to realize this identity is liberated from the endless series of rebirths of samsara. The soul of such a person merges with brahman and remains in brahman forever. At the same time it is freed from the influence of karma. This is the highest goal and the truest path - the &quot;path of the gods&quot; (devayana), in contrast to the ordinary path - the &quot;path of the fathers&quot; (pityrnyana). Devayana is attained through ascesis and supreme knowledge.</p>

        <p>Thus, in Upanishadic philosophy, man (unlike Christianity or Islam, for instance) is not seen in relation to others or to humanity as a whole. The human life itself is thought of differently here. Man is not the &quot;crown of creation&quot; of God, nor does he possess a single life. His life is an endless chain of rebirths. But he has the opportunity to break the circle of samsara, to exit the chain of births and reach the highest goal of liberation from existence. Life, therefore, is seen as a long process of alternation of different lives and one has to live them so as to finally leave samsara, i.e., to get rid of life. Hence the meaning of ancient Indian philosophy, and the nature of the worldview of the Indians was different from that of the West. It was not aimed at changing the external conditions of existence - nature and society - but at self-improvement. In other words, it was introverted rather than extroverted. Besides, the very term &quot;philosophy&quot; as wisdom, which emerged within the framework of Western European culture, is of little use to denote the system of views and worldview of the thinkers of ancient India. In this context Hegel apparently did not get far from the truth when he wrote that &#39;philosophy in its proper sense began in the West&#39;. Although to deny philosophy in general in the Ancient Eastern cultural tradition would, we think, be wrong. Here wisdom is not primarily concerned with the justification of theoretical concepts, aiming at the search for truth in an empirical or rational way, but with the supreme cognition and self-knowledge through ascesis, direct comprehension of Brahman and individual identity with him. The path to truth is the path of moral perfection of the individual, not the path of theoretical knowledge.</p>

        <p>The Upanishads have had an enormous influence on the further development of philosophical thought in India. Thus, the doctrine of samsara and karma becomes one of the basic teachings for the subsequent development of all religious and philosophical movements in India. The Upanishads have had a great influence on the various philosophical systems of Hinduism and Buddhism in particular. Their influence is also found in the views of such major thinkers as Rammohon Rai, Gandhi, Schopenhauer and others.</p>

        <p><strong>Philosophy of the epic period. </strong>The name &quot;epic period&quot; (from the word &quot;epic&quot;) is due to the fact that at this time the Ramayana and the Mahabharata serve as a means of expressing the heroic and the divine in human relations. During this period, the ideas of the Upanishads are heavily criticised in the Bhagavadgita (one of the books of the Mahabharata).</p>

        <p>This period in the development of Indian philosophy begins in the 6th century B.C., when Indian society undergoes great changes: agrarian and craft production develops, social differentiation increases, the institution of tribal power loses its influence and the power of the monarchy increases. At the same time, there were changes in the outlook of Indian society. In particular, criticism of Vedic Brahmanism intensifies. Intuition gives way to enquiry, religion to philosophy. Within philosophy itself various, including opposing and warring schools and systems emerge, reflecting the real contradictions of the time.</p>

        <p><strong>Unorthodox schools in Indian philosophy.</strong> Among the many adherents of new views who rebelled against the authority of the Vedas, we should first of all name the representatives of such systems as: Charvaka (materialists), Jainism, Buddhism. All of them belong to the unorthodox schools of Indian philosophy.</p>

        <p><strong>Charvaka</strong> is a materialistic doctrine in ancient and medieval India. A later variety of a related philosophical concept, lokayata, with which it is sometimes identified altogether. No works of this school have survived, and the source of knowledge about this doctrine is the statements of representatives of other schools.</p>

        <p>Charvaka rejects the concept of Brahman, atman, samsara and karma. The basis of all things here is matter in the form of the four primary elements: earth, water, fire and air. Both life and consciousness are seen as derived from these material elements. Matter can think. Death is the end of everything. The name &quot;lokayata&quot; corresponds to the essence and content of this doctrine - there is only this world, or loca. Materialists are therefore called lokayatis. They are also called charwakas, after the founder of this theory-Charwaka.</p>

        <p>The ontological essence of this doctrine corresponds to the theory of cognition. The basis of this theory is the perception of the world. Only that which is cognised by direct perception is true. Therefore there is no basis for the existence of another world that is not perceived by the senses. No other world can exist. Consequently, religion is a foolish delusion. Belief in a god and another world is, from the point of view of this school, a sign of feeble-mindedness, weakness, cowardice.</p>

        <p>The ethical concept of the Charvaks is based on unlimited enjoyment - hedonism (from the Greek hedone - pleasure). Recognising only such realities of life as suffering and enjoyment within the sensuous existence of the individual, this school regards wealth and enjoyment as the goals of human existence. The motto of this school is to eat, drink and enjoy this life today, for death always comes to everyone. &quot;While life is still yours - live joyfully: no one can escape the piercing gaze of death&quot;. This theory thus affirms selfishness and preaches earthly human desires. All moral standards, according to this doctrine, are mere human conventions which should be disregarded. In evaluating the philosophy of the materialists, it has done much to criticize the old religion and philosophy and to debunk the authority of the Vedas, their untruthfulness and inconsistency.</p>

        <p>&quot;The philosophy of the Charvaks,&quot; writes S. Radhakrishnan, the greatest modern philosopher of India, &quot;represents a fanatical effort to free the modern generation from the burden of the past, which has prevailed over it. The removal of dogmatism, which took place by means of this philosophy, was necessary in order to make room for constructive efforts of reason.&quot; At the same time, this philosophy was a one-sided worldview, denying the role of intellect, reason in knowledge. Therefore, from its point of view, it was impossible to explain where abstract, universal ideas and moral ideals came from. The result of this one-sidedness was nihilism, scepticism and subjectivism. Since the sense organs belong to the individual, therefore the truth can only be one&#39;s own. The result of this one-sidedness is their rejection of higher moral goals and values. However, in spite of these obvious and serious shortcomings, the Charvak school laid the foundation for a critique of the Brahmanical trend in Indian philosophy, undermined the authority of the Vedas and had a considerable influence on the further development of philosophical thought in India.</p>

        <p><strong>Jainism.</strong> Mahavira Vardha-mana (VI century B.C.) is considered to be its founder. He also received the name of Jaina, which means the victor (i.e. victory over the cycle of rebirths). At the centre of this direction is the being of the individual. The essence of the person, from the point of view of Jainism, is dualistic: spiritual (jiva) and material (ajiva). The link between jiva and ajiva is karma. However, karma itself is understood here, unlike in the Upanishads, as subtle matter and not as the law of retribution. It is the union of non-living, gross matter with the soul through karma that gives birth to the personality. And karma constantly accompanies the soul in an endless chain of rebirths.</p>

        <p>The human soul is forced to wander, constantly being reborn, as long as it is bound to subtle matter. But right knowledge and asceticism can help it to free itself from the material world (ajiva). In this case, the soul goes to the higher realm, where it permanently and abides in pure spirituality. This is because the jiva exists in two forms of being: imperfect and perfect. In the first case it is in union with matter and in a state of suffering. In the second, the jiva is freed from this bond and becomes free, able to control her own being. In this case it passes into a state of bliss - nirvana, the highest state of the soul when the ultimate goal is achieved.</p>

        <p>Accordingly, Jainism recognizes two kinds of knowledge: the imperfect, based on experience and reason, and the perfect, based on intuition and grasping the truth by direct discernment. The latter is accessible only to those who have freed themselves from the dependence of the material world (ajiva). At the same time, Jainism recognizes the relativity of knowledge and the possibility of multiple points of view in considering a subject. Its dialectical method is related to this.</p>

        <p>A characteristic feature of Jainism&#39;s philosophical and ethical concept is its elaboration of rules and norms of human behaviour and the requirement of their strict observance. The ethical upbringing of the individual is the decisive factor in the transition of being an individual from an imperfect state to a perfect state. Although karma decides everything, our present life, which is in our own power, can change the impact of the past. And with excessive effort we can avoid the impact of karma as well. Therefore, there is no absolute fatalism in Jainist teachings, as it may seem at first sight.</p>

        <p>The right life of man is associated with asceticism, which was practiced in India by many great saints who even put themselves to death. Only asceticism leads to the cessation of rebirths and liberation of the soul from samsara. And the liberation is of an individual nature. Everyone is freed by himself. However, the ethics of Jainism, though egocentric, is far from being egoistic, as in the teachings of the Charvaks. Selfishness and individualism imply the opposition of the individual to the social environment, the assertion of one&#39;s own interests at the expense of others. Meanwhile, the basic ethical principles of Jainism: detachment from worldly wealth, vanity, passions, respect for all living beings, etc. are little compatible with selfishness and individualism. It should be noted that the philosophy of Jainism retains its influence in India even today.</p>

        <p><strong>Buddhism</strong>, like Jainism, emerged in the sixth century B.C. Its founder was the Indian prince Siddhartha Gautama, who was later named the Buddha (awakened, enlightened) because after many years of asceticism and asceticism he achieved awakening, that is, he came to understand the right way of life, which rejects extremes. A characteristic feature of this teaching is its ethico-practical orientation, and the central issue it is concerned with is the being of the individual. At the heart of Buddhism are the &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot;:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - human existence from birth to death is inextricably linked to suffering;</p>

        <p>- there is a cause of suffering, which is the thirst for existence (striving for life), leading through joys and passions to rebirth;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - there is liberation from suffering, the removal of the cause of suffering, i.e., the removal of that thirst for being;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - there is the path leading to liberation from suffering, which rejects both a life devoted only to sensual pleasures and the path of ascesis and self-torture. This is the Buddhist principle of the so-called middle path, which recommends avoiding extremes.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberation from suffering as the ultimate goal of a person&#39;s being is, first and foremost, the destruction of desire, or, more precisely, the extinguishing of passion. Related to this is the most important concept of Buddhism in the moral sphere: the concept of tolerance and relativity. According to this concept, it is not a matter of some generally binding moral precepts, but of not causing harm to others. This is the main principle of personal behaviour, based on a sense of kindness and perfect contentment.</p>

        <p>Buddhism&#39;s concept of cognition is also organically linked to its ethics. Cognition is here a necessary way and means of achieving the ultimate goal of being a person. Buddhism eliminates the distinction between sensual and rational forms of cognition and establishes the practice of meditation (from Latin rneditatio - concentrated reflection) - deep mental concentration and detachment from external objects and inner feelings. The result is a direct experience of the wholeness of being, complete self-deepening and self-satisfaction. A state of absolute freedom and independence of one&#39;s inner being is attained, which is exactly the same as the quenching of desires. This is liberation or nirvana, a state of supreme bliss, the ultimate goal of one&#39;s aspirations and being, characterized by detachment from life&#39;s cares and desires. What is meant is not the death of man, but his exit from the cycle of rebirths, his liberation from samsara and mergence with the divine.</p>

        <p>The practice of meditation is the essence of Buddhist insight into life. Like prayer in Christianity, meditation is at the heart of Buddhism. Its ultimate goal is enlightenment, or the state of nirvana. One should keep in mind that the system of Buddhism is defined by the principle of the absolute autonomy of the individual, his or her independence of the environment. Buddhism regards all connections of man with the real world, including the social world, as negative and generally harmful to man. Hence the need for liberation from imperfect real existence, from external objects and feelings. Related to this is the conviction of most Buddhists that the passions of the human body and the restlessness associated with it must be overcome. The main way of doing this is to achieve nirvana.</p>

        <p>Thus the philosophy of Buddhism, like that of Jainism, is egocentric and introverted.</p>

        <p><strong>The orthodox schools in ancient Indian philosophy.</strong> Unlike the non-orthodox schools (Charvaks, Jainism, Buddhism) in the history of ancient Indian philosophy there were also orthodox schools which did not deny the authority of the Vedas, but, on the contrary, relied on them. Let us consider the main philosophical ideas of these schools.</p>

        <p><strong>Vedanta</strong> (completion of the Vedas) is the most influential system, the most important philosophical basis of Hinduism. It recognizes Brahman as the absolute spiritual essence of the world. Individual souls (atmans) through knowledge or love of god attain salvation by uniting with god. The way out of the cycle of births (samsara) is to consider all things from the point of view of the higher truth; in the knowledge that the outer world around us is an illusory world and the real changeless reality is Brahman, with which the atman is identified. The main way to attain this true knowledge is through observance of moral norms and meditation, which means intensive reflection on the problems of the Vedas.</p>

        <p>The help of the teacher plays an important part in this. Therefore, one of the requirements of Vedanta is that the student should follow the teacher obediently and meditate on the truths of Vedanta continuously with a view to direct and constant contemplation of the truth. Knowledge liberates the soul. Ignorance, on the contrary, enslaves the soul and increases the desire for sensual pleasures. The study of Vedanta is the main means of liberation of the soul.</p>

        <p><strong>Mimansa</strong> (reflection, a study of the Vedic text on sacrifices). This system is concerned with explaining the ritual of the Vedas. The teachings of the Vedas are here closely associated with dharma - the idea of duty, the fulfilment of which involves primarily sacrifice. This fulfilment of one&#39;s duty is what leads to gradual redemption from karma and to liberation as the cessation of rebirths and suffering.</p>

        <p><strong>Sankhya </strong>(number, enumeration) - It is not based directly on the text of the Vedas, but on independent experience and reflection. In this respect Sankhya differs from Vedanta and Mimansa. The doctrine of this school expresses the view that the root cause of the world is matter, nature (prakrita). Along with nature, the existence of the absolute soul (purusha) is recognized. It is through its presence in all things that things themselves exist. When prakriti and purusha come together, the initial principles of the world, both material (water, air, earth, etc.) and spiritual (intellect, self-consciousness, etc.) emerge. Thus, Sankhya represents a dualistic trend in the philosophy of Hinduism.</p>

        <p><strong>Yoga</strong> (tension, deep reflection, contemplation). The philosophy of this school aims at practical psychological training. Its theoretical basis is Sankhya, although Yoga also recognises a personal god. An important place in this system is occupied by the explanation of the rules of mental training, the successive stages of which are: self-observation (yama), mastering the respiration in certain body postures (asana), insulation of the senses from external influences (pratyahara), concentration of thought (dharana), meditation (dhyana), the state of withdrawal (samadhi). The last stage includes liberation of the soul from the physical body, breaking of samsara and karma. Ethical standards of yoga are connected with the formation of a highly moral person.</p>

        <p><strong>Vaishyaka.</strong> In the early stages of development this system contains strong materialistic elements. According to it all things are constantly changing, but there are stable elements in them - spherical atoms. Atoms are eternal, created by nobody and are of many qualities (17 qualities of atoms). Various animate and inanimate objects arise from them. Although the world consists of atoms, the driving force of its development is God, who acts in accordance with the law of karma.</p>

        <p><strong>Nyaya</strong> (rule, logic) is the doctrine of forms of thought. In this system the main point is to explore metaphysical problems by means of logic. Nyaya starts from liberation as the ultimate goal of human life. In the view of this school, the conditions and methods for true cognition as a means of attaining liberation can be determined with the help of logic and its laws. Liberation itself is understood as the cessation of the negative factors of suffering.</p>

        <p>The Bhagavadgita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is considered the most significant and famous book of not only the epic period, but of the entire history of India. It forms part of the sixth book of the Mahabharata. &quot;Bhagavadgita&quot; in translation means the song of Bhagavata, i.e. the god Krishna, or divine song. It was written around the middle of the first millennium B.C. and expressed the need of the masses to replace the old Upanishad religion with its skinny abstractions and led by an undefined Absolute with a less abstract and formal one.</p>

        <p>&quot;Bhagavadgita&quot; with its living personal god (Krishna) successfully accomplished this task and initiated a new trend of religious thought, Hinduism. It must be borne in mind that the philosophy of the Gita by no means denies, as has already been said, the authority of the Vedas, but on the contrary, it is greatly influenced by the Upanishads. Moreover, the very philosophical basis of the Gita is derived from the Upanishads. The acceptability of the religious-philosophical basis of Hinduism to the masses has determined the fact that by the beginning of the new era it had gained a decisive influence in the ideological sphere of Indian society.</p>

        <p>According to the Bhagavadgita, the eternally changing natural, material reality is not the primary reality - prakriti. The primary, eternal and unchanging being is the supreme Brahman. One should not grieve over death, for it is not extinction. Although the individual form of human existence may change, but the essence of man after death is not destroyed, that is, the atman of man remains unchanged, even if the body has become ashes. In the spirit of the Upanishads, the Gita identifies the two beginnings, brahman and atman. Behind the mortal body is atman, behind the transient objects of the world is brahman. These two beginnings are one and identical in nature. The main object of knowledge in the Bhagavadgita is the supreme brahman, which has neither beginning nor end. Having cognised him, one becomes immortal.</p>

        <p>In form, the Gita is a dialogue between the epic hero Arjuna and the god Krishna, who narratively appears as Arjuna&#39;s charioteer and instructor. The central tenor of the book is that Krishna is the supreme divinity of Hinduism, with the book as its philosophical foundation. Unlike the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgita focuses more on moral issues and is characterised by its emotional nature. The dialogue between Arjuna and the god Krishna takes place on the eve of a decisive battle, when the general Arjuna is in doubt as to whether he has the right to kill his kin. He is thus in a situation where he has to make a decisive moral choice. This choice, which involves figuring out one&#39;s place in the moral world, is the central question facing the hero of the book and every human being. The main problem to be solved is based on the realisation of the profound moral contradiction between man&#39;s practical duty and higher moral requirements.</p>

        <p>Therefore, unlike the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gita does not focus on the external, ritual factors of attaining the moral order (sacrifices), but on the inner moral freedom of the individual. Sacrifices through which only rich people can win the favour of the gods are insufficient to achieve inner freedom. The attainment of inner freedom is achieved by renunciation of external, sensual pretensions and temptations that lurk at every turn. In this connection, the book develops the doctrine of yoga, one of the branches of Indian thought that has developed a whole complex of techniques that enable one to attain a special state of mind and psychic equilibrium. Although it should be borne in mind that the roots of yoga are very ancient, and that yoga itself forms a common element in most ancient Indian systems. In the Bhagavadgita, yoga appears as a method of mental education, allowing one to free oneself and purify oneself from all kinds of delusion and to know the true reality, the primary being - Brahman, the eternal spirit, which is the foundation of all things.</p>

        <p>The protagonist of the Gita and seeks moral justification for his actions in the deepest foundations of the eternal spirit - brahman. To attain brahmana requires an ascetic renunciation of all transient, selfish aspirations, sensual lusts. But the renunciation is the way to true freedom and the attainment of absolute value. Arjuna&#39;s true battlefield is the life of his own soul and it is necessary to defeat that which impedes its true development. It is by defying temptations and subduing passions that he tries to conquer the true realm of man - true freedom. Achieving it is not an easy task. It requires ascesis, suffering and self-denial.</p>

        name: "Philosophy of Ancient China",
        description: `<p>In historical-philosophical science to date there is no generally accepted point of view on the periodization of the development of Chinese philosophy. We shall consider its content mainly in accordance with chronological periods, distinguished on the basis of ruling dynasties, as many authors have done.</p>

        <p><strong>The origin of Chinese philosophy.</strong> The Chinese philosophy was born and formed during the Shang (XVIII - XII centuries B.C.) and Zhou (XI - III centuries B.C.) dynasties. Its philosophy is rooted in mythological thinking. Already within the framework of mythology stands out the highest principle governing the world order. During the Shang dynasty, the Shandi (Supreme Emperor) was considered the supreme principle, the deity that created all existing things, and during the Zhou dynasty the idea of &quot;the will of Heaven&quot; as the all-powerful original and the root cause of all things emerged.</p>

        <p>At the same time with the spread of the religious worldview, philosophical thinking also began to develop. As early as during the Shang dynasty, notions of dark and light began to emerge. Dark and light began to be regarded as properties inherent in objects, the opposition of which causes development and changes in things and processes. These views were first recorded in inscriptions on fortune-telling books and dice, which referred to a sunny day as light and an overcast day as non-light.</p>

        <p>These and similar notions, as they developed, began to be filled with a deeper meaning and broader content. The bright beginning began to express not only &quot;light day&quot;, but also the properties of the sky, the sun, hardness, strength, man, etc., and the dark beginning - the properties of the earth, the moon, night, coldness, softness, weakness, woman, etc. Gradually the notions of dark and light acquire an abstract meaning as well.</p>

        <p><strong>&ldquo;&quot;The Book of Changes&rdquo;.</strong> The origin of the philosophy of ancient China should be looked for in the first, and still semi-mythical, monuments of Chinese writing, especially the famous &quot;Book of Changes&quot; (&quot;I Ching&quot;) the commentaries to which laid the foundation of the philosophy of China.</p>

        <p>&quot;The Book of Changes is one of the primary sources for the development of philosophical thought in China. The texts are of different times (12th to 16th century B.C.). The Book of Changes traces the transition from a mythological reflection of the world to a philosophical understanding of it. The text of this book reflects the ancient Chinese myths about the two spirits, Yin and Yang, which take a conceptual form here.</p>

        <p><strong>Yang</strong> is masculine, luminous and active (spirit). It rules the Sky. Yin is female, dark and passive element. It rules the Earth. In this case it is not a dualistic but rather a dialectic connection between them, as Yang and Yin can not act separately from each other but only in mutual interaction, in joining their powers. The alternation of Yang and Yin is called the path (Tao) that all things go through. &quot;The Book of Changes&quot; and traces the Tao - the way of things and the way of the world in motion. One of the main tasks of man is to understand his place in the world, to &quot;connect his power with heaven and earth&quot;.</p>

        <p>Thus, already in the Book of Changes the naive dialectic of Chinese philosophical thought is set forth, which is linked to the affirmation of the contradictory nature of the world, mutual attraction and mutual alienation of light and dark, development and change of the world.</p>

        <p><strong>Philosophy in the Chunqu - Zhangguo period.</strong> The Chunqu period (8th to 5th century B.C.) - Zhangguo period (5th to 3rd century B.C.) was a time of great changes in China. During this period, the transition to a feudal society could not fail to have an impact on all aspects of life, including the outlook of the people. A situation called the &quot;rivalry of all schools&quot; emerged in China, giving a powerful impetus to the development of philosophical thought. Among these schools, the main six are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the school of servants (Confucianists);</li>
          <li>the school of Moists (followers of Mo-tzu);</li>
          <li>the school of Taoists (the central category - Dao);</li>
          <li>the school of legalists (legists); the school of nominalists (school of names);</li>
          <li>the school of Yin and Yang (natural philosophers).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Confucianism and Taoism stand out among these schools. Let us dwell on the main points of the main schools.</p>

        <p><strong>Confucianism.</strong> It is one of the most important trends in Chinese philosophy, and covers the periods of ancient and medieval Chinese society. The founder of this school was Confucius (551-479 B.C.). In the literature he is often referred to as Kun-tsu, which means &quot;Kung Teacher&quot;. And this is not by chance, already at the age of just over 20 years, he rose to fame as the most famous teacher of China. The main source of his teachings is the book Lun Yu (Conversations and Judgments) - statements and conversations with his students recorded by his followers.</p>

        <p>At the centre of his teachings is the human being, his mental and moral development and conduct. Concerned about the decay of contemporary society and the fall of morals, Confucius focused on education of an ideal, noble man (junzi), which should be carried out in a spirit of respect for people around him and for society. It must include the development of proper rules of conduct and the obligation for each person to perform his or her functions, and Confucius views the individual as a functional element of society, as a human function subordinate to society. The noble man has his antipode, the so-called &quot;low man&quot; (xiao zhen). Such is he, who in his actions is guided only by considerations of personal gain, who everywhere looking for companions, but does not respect them or himself, who solicits favours, and getting the desired, forgetting about the gratitude. When Teacher Kuhn contrasts the noble husband with the low man, his words speak for themselves:</p>

        <p>The noble husband lives in harmony with all. The low man seeks his own kind.</p>

        <p>The noble husband is impartial and does not tolerate groupthink. An inferior man likes pitting people against each other and forming cliques.</p>

        <p>A noble man endures adversity. An inferior man is in trouble and dissolves.</p>

        <p>The noble man waits with dignity for the dictates of Heaven. A lowly man looks forward to good fortune.</p>

        <p>A noble man helps people to see good in themselves and does not teach people to see bad in themselves. The low man does the opposite.</p>

        <p>A noble man is serene at heart. An inferior man is always preoccupied.</p>

        <p>What the noble man seeks is in himself. What the low man is looking for is in others.</p>

        <p>The main quality of the noble husband, nurtured by ritual and music, Confucius called &quot;humanity&quot; (zheng). Hieroglyph zheng consists of the characters &quot;human&quot; and &quot;two&quot;, that is, it denotes the relationship between people, something between people, what the Chinese tradition and was considered a true human being. The Conversations and Judgments discusses humanity frequently, although the Master himself, according to his disciples, spoke of it reluctantly. Each time he spoke, he defined it differently. After all, each case requires its own word and deed. To be human for Confucius just means to be different with different people. Once, in answer to the question, &#39;What is humanity&#39;, the Master replied, &#39;to love people&#39;. This answer refers to the substance of the moral ideal. And if we want to know what a man endowed with humanity should be like, we have to turn to another explanation: &quot;A man endowed with humanity has five qualities: he is courteous, generous, honest, diligent and kind. He who is courteous in his address avoids insults. He who is generous will attract people to him. He who is honest will enjoy the trust of others. He who is diligent will succeed. He who is kind will be able to use people in service. Some of Confucius&#39; judgments emphasize the inseparable link between &#39;humanity&#39; and ritual, and once the Master clarified the meaning of &#39;humanity&#39; in his famous maxim, which recalls the evangelical commandment: &#39;Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself&#39;.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Confucius all social and moral norms of behaviour and upbringing are based on religious ritual. In fact, the whole text of the Lun Yu is a description of it. In ritual Confucius can be said to have discovered a new kind of wisdom and philosophy. The core of wisdom is the observance of ritual, and the essence of philosophy is its correct explanation and understanding. Here, too, as in ancient Indian philosophy, the difference in understanding of philosophy itself from the Western European tradition is very striking.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the importance of religious ritual for man, Confucius also considered the cause of confusion in society to be the impoverishment of religious feelings and the non-observance of ritual. He considered the universal unity of all people and their unity with the cosmos as a respectful attitude towards Heaven, a sense of divine unity. For him God was Heaven as the sacral moral element governing the world. The tsar himself had the title &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; and was regarded as mediator between Heaven and mankind. The manifestation of the divine moral force on earth and is, according to Confucius, ritual, which originally had a sacred character.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manifestation of zhen is all moral qualities of personality, but the basis of zhen is xiao, which has a special place among other categories. Xiao means filial reverence, respect for parents and elders. Xiao is also the most effective method of ruling a country, which Confucius regarded as a big family. Therefore the relationship of ruler and subject should, in Confucius&#39; opinion, be built similarly to that of father and son, elder brother and younger.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of &quot;zheng min&quot; - &quot;correction of names&quot; is also of great importance in the education of the Jun Tzu. Its essence is that all things should be brought into line with their names. Therefore, government activity, for example, should begin with &quot;correcting the names&quot;, and a noble man &quot;first sees the cause in the word, and after it is said acts&quot;. If &quot;the names are wrong, the speech is contradictory; when the speech is contradictory, the deed does not end in success&quot;. It is important to note that Confucius did not separate word and deed, but considered them in unity. Suffice it to mention his famous aphorism: &quot;I listen to people&#39;s words and look at their actions&quot;.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The concept of the &quot;golden mean&quot; of Confucius is also noteworthy. &quot;The way of the golden mean&quot; is one of the basic elements of his ideology and the most important principle of virtue, for &quot;the golden mean, as a virtuous principle, is the highest principle&quot;. And it should be used in governing the people to mitigate contradictions, allowing neither &quot;excessiveness&quot; nor &quot;backwardness&quot;. Here the thinker is actually talking about asserting the need for compromise in social administration.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confucius&#39; ideas played an important role in the development of all aspects of Chinese society, including his philosophical outlook. He himself became an object of worship and was canonised in 1503. Philosophers who supported and developed Confucius&#39; teachings were called Confucianists, and his general trend was Confucianism. After Confucius&#39; death Confucianism split up into a number of schools. The most important of them were idealistic Meng-tzu (about 372-289 B.C.) and materialistic Xun-tzu (about 313-238 B.C.). However, Confucianism remained the dominant ideology in China until the establishment of the People&#39;s Republic of China in 1949.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Taoism</strong> (from Chinese Tao Jia - the school of Tao). Together with Confucianism, Taoism is the most important philosophical school in China founded in the second half of the 1st millennium B.C. Lao Tzu (6th - 5th century B.C.) is considered the founder of this school.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the heart of the teachings of the Taoists is the category of Tao (literally - the way, the road). Tao is invisible universal natural law of nature, human society, individual behaviour and thinking. Tao is inseparable from the material world and governs it. It is not by chance that Tao is sometimes compared with the logos. of the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctrine of Tao reveals elements of the original dialectics: Tao is empty and at the same time inexhaustible; it is inactive, but thus makes everything; it rests and simultaneously moves; it is the beginning for itself, but it has neither beginning nor end, etc. The cognition of Tao is identical with the cognition of the universal, internal law of nature&#39;s self-development and self-organization. In addition, cognition of Tao implies the ability to conform to this law.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Taoism everyone must observe the principle of following Tao as the universal law of spontaneous emergence and disappearance of the whole universe. Related to this is one of the main categories of Taoism: inaction, or non-action. By observing the law of the Tao, one can do nothing. Lao Tzu therefore denies any effort of either the individual or society in relation to nature, for all tension leads to disharmony and increases the contradictions between man and the world. And he who seeks to manipulate the world is doomed to failure and destruction. The main principle of personal conduct is to preserve the &quot;measure of things&quot;. That is why non-action (wu wei) is one of the basic and central ideas of Taoism; it is what leads to happiness, prosperity and total freedom.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From here, a wise ruler follows the Tao without doing anything to rule the country, and then the people prosper and order and harmony reigns in society by itself. In the Tao all are equal to each other - noble and slave, ugly and handsome, rich and poor, etc. Therefore the wise man looks equally to one and to the other. He strives to unite with eternity and does not regret either life or death, for he understands their inevitability, i.e. he looks at the world as if from a distance, detached and aloof. As you can see, this view is the opposite of the concept of &quot;junzi&quot; in Confucianism, in which a &quot;noble man&quot; must engage in self-improvement and take part in governing others.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taoism as well as Confucianism had a significant influence on all further development of culture and philosophy in China.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moism and Legism also played an important role in the history of philosophy in ancient China.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Moism </strong>(Moist School) - It takes its name from its founder Mo-tzu (Mo Di) (about 475-395 BC). In his early years, Mo-tzu was a follower of Confucius, but later broke with his school and founded a new, opposing school - Moism. In his time, Mo-tzu enjoyed the same fame as Confucius, and both were said to be &quot;the famous scholars of Kung and Mo&quot;. Moism was widespread in China in V - III centuries BC. This school was like a strictly constructed paramilitary organization, whose members strictly obeyed the orders of its head.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The titles of the chapters of &quot;Mo-tzu&quot; (&quot;Treatise of Teacher Mo&quot;) reflect the main points of the philosopher&#39;s concept: &quot;reverence for wisdom&quot;, &quot;reverence for unity&quot;, &quot;universal love&quot;, &quot;savings in expenditure&quot;, &quot;denial of music and entertainment&quot;, &quot;denial of the will of Heaven&quot;, etc. The basic ideas of Mo-tzu&#39;s philosophy are universal love, duty, prosperity and mutual benefit (profit). According to his teachings, universal, love and humanity should be obligatory for all people in the state and all should concern themselves with mutual benefit. He asserts the unity of humanity and duty with the benefit they bring and thus diverges from the Confucianists. Considering benefit as the content and goal of humanitarianism and duty, Mo-tzu develops the concept of utilitarianism, from which Confucius&#39; teachings were free. For the latter, duty and humanity came first.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main attention Mo-tzu paid to social ethics, which he associated through strict organization with despotic power of the head of state. In opposing Confucius, he argued that theorizing is a futile exercise, the main thing is pragmatic expediency, and work activity.</p>

        <p><strong>Legism.</strong> This school emerged and formed in the 6th-2nd centuries B.C. Legism (from Latin lex - gen. case from legis - law) is a doctrine of the school of legalists, which reveals an ethical and political concept of governing man, society and the state. Its most prominent representatives are Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Tao, and Han Fei. Its most prominent representative was Han Fei who completed the construction of the theoretical system of legism.</p>

        <p>Legism emerged in a bitter struggle with early Confucianism. Although both schools sought to create a powerful, well-governed state, they had different justifications for the principles and methods of its construction. Confucianism was based, as you know, on the moral qualities of the people and stressed the role and importance of ritual and moral standards in establishing order in the country and the principles of governance. The Legists, on the contrary, proceeded from the law, arguing that politics was incompatible with morality. In their view, the ruler&#39;s main impact on the masses should be through rewards and punishment. In this case, punishment plays a major role. The state and its development should not be governed by wishful thinking, but by developing agriculture, strengthening the army and, at the same time, fooling the people.</p>

        <p>The Legists&#39; conception of the state was the theory of the despotic state. Everyone should be equal before the law, except the ruler himself, who is the sole creator of laws. It was legism that played a decisive role in shaping the imperial-bureaucratic system of governance in China, which lasted until the beginning of the 20th century. Instead of the traditional principle of the inheritance of offices, they offered a systematic renewal of the state apparatus by appointing officials, equal opportunities in administrative positions, unification of officials&#39; thinking and their personal responsibility.</p>

        name: "Development of philosophical thought in Central Asia",
        description: `<p>Central Asia is one of the regions, where science, philosophy, religion, literature and art developed since ancient times, the region with rich history. In XIII centuries B.C. slave-owning relations were established in Central Asia. The population of Central Asia at that time was called Scythians by Greek historians and Sakas by Iranians.</p>

        <p>Farming and cattle breeding had an important place in the life of the ancient peoples of Central Asia. Farming in the area was based on artificial irrigation, which led to the development of irrigation facilities. The first cultural centres began to emerge. Aramaic writing was widespread in Central Asia; the Khorezmian and Sogdian alphabets emerged on the basis of Aramaic. A rich literary heritage began to emerge. The first monuments of Sak oral literature emerged: Tomeris, Spitamen, Zarin and Shirak. - heroes of the myths of Central Asia which praised their patriotism.</p>

        <p>From the sixth century BC to the third century, the world view of Zoroastrianism prevailed in Central Asia. Zoroastrianism was not only a religion, but also the ideology of the time. Sacred book of Zoroastrianism &quot;Avesta&quot; (written on processed skin from 12000 cattle) was collected during several centuries. During the invasion of Alexander the Great much of it was lost. During the Arshahid era, the rest of it was arranged as &quot;Avesta&quot;, which reflected the socio-economic, legal, and ethical views of Central Asian peoples.</p>

        <p><strong>&quot;Avesta&quot;</strong> describes the religious beliefs, myths and legends about creation, the geography of political and socio-economic life, nature, vegetation, and science. It provides information about the climate, water, fauna, the origins of the land, deserts, and mountains of ancient Turan. The Avesta also extoled fidelity to one&#39;s word, sincerity, objectivity, mutual respect and morality, and discouraged envy, pretence and craftiness. The world is treated as a testing ground for man. &quot;The Avesta contains many religious precepts and philosophical ideas about faith, purity of soul, and the refusal of bad intentions and words. One of the most important philosophical ideas of the Avesta is to call people to labour, to create with their own hands material goods and to live in prosperity. In the religion of Zoroastrianism, its sacred book, the earth and air, considered to be the material basis of the world, are called sacred. Land and air were so valued that it was a sin to bury animals and even people, to throw their corpses into water and to burn them. To prevent the corpses from polluting the earth, air and water, they were buried in special ceramic vessels. Thus, the Avesta is the holy book of the oldest religion on earth and an encyclopedic compilation of history, development of thinking, language, writing, culture and philosophy.</p>

        <p>The foundations of Oriental society, which had developed and reached their peak, began to crumble by the 2nd-3rd centuries. Feudal relations were developing. The complexity and inconsistency of this process was also reflected in the philosophical views of the era. A new movement, monism, had emerged. According to the doctrine of its founder Moni, there was a world of light, the good, and a world of darkness, the evil. There is an eternal struggle between them. Good must win in the end, and a man by his behaviour and his whole life should contribute to the victory of good over evil, since the doctrine of Moni was directed against slavery and the ruling religion, his followers were driven into exile.</p>

        <p>In the fifth and sixth centuries, a revolt led by Mazdak arose against increasing oppression in Central Asia and Iran. His doctrine defended the interests of peasants and served to establish equality and justice. History knows that in V-VI centuries, after long years of battles against Samanids in Iran, the Turkish Khanate was established in the north and subjugated the peoples of Central Asia. The ancient Turkic language began to spread there. In VIII century, Central Asia was conquered by Arabs and Islam was introduced. The local population struggled against the Arabs for a long time. In the ninth and tenth centuries, the Samanid Empire emerged on the territory of Uzbekistan. Islam remained the dominant religion.</p>

        <p>In the eighth century, various Islamic movements emerged: the Mu&#39;takallim, the Mu&#39;tazili, Sufism and others. At that time, the necessity of defending the foundations of Islam, and struggle between the currents resulted in the Qalam teaching. Al-Ashari (874-941) and Mansur Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Maturudi were founders of the Kalam. The Mu&#39;tazilis were against free analysis of the Ayats of the Qur&#39;an, the Mu&#39;tazilis were in favour of realising by means of logic the meaning of the rules. According to the Mu&#39;tazilis, belief in a foreordained destiny harms the glory of Allah, for bad deeds become his will.</p>

        <p><strong>&quot;Mutazila&quot;</strong> (detached) originated in the Ummavid era and became widespread during the Abbasid era. Mu&#39;tazilah was widely supported during the time of Caliph Ma&#39;mun (813-830), and its ideas formed the basis of the state ideology. However, during the time of the Caliph Mutawakkil (847-861), his followers were declared &quot;infidels&quot; and &quot;godless&quot;. Mu&#39;tazilism is interpreted in many studies as a current of Islam. The Mu&#39;tazilians became famous as the initiators of purely philosophical thinking in the Arab Caliphate. Their merit is that along with sensual experience and traditional knowledge, they put forward a third criterion of knowledge - intellectual cognition. They paid great attention to the study of philosophical issues, considering mental cognition to be the main method. The ideas of Mu&#39;tazilism spread in Central Asia and centres of scientific, philosophical thought began to emerge.</p>

        <p>The Mu&#39;tazili religious and philosophical movements of wujudi mumqin and wujudi wujudi (vahdad ul mumqin and vahdad ul wujudi) were formed in Central Asia under the influence of the Mu&#39;tazili. The representatives of the vujudi mumkin (or vujudion - pantheism) current are Al-Kindi, Ibn Rumi, Farabi, Ibn Sina, Omar Khayyam and others, who divided beings into vujudi mumkin and vujudi wujib. The wujudi mumkin was based on causality, its existence coming from its essence and not from other things. Based on this rule, Farabi divides beings into six degrees. The first is Allah - wujudi wujib, the other five: mind, soul, form, matter, heaven - wujudi mumkin. These degrees are interrelated causally, but the first cause has no cause of its own. In his work Risola fi tahsil al mawjudat, Ibn Sino defines wahdid-ul mawjud and wahdod ul wujudd as follows: Wahdod ul-Wujdad means Allah, but he is not the creator of everything as the Qur&#39;an says, but the cause, i.e. the first cause of all beings and part of it. Such a view makes it possible to explain natural phenomena (including human nature) on the basis of independent internal causes, opening a wide way for the development of science.</p>

        <p>The religious-philosophical ideas of the Mutazilians led to the formation of the theoretical rule of two truths. According to it, there are divine and secular (scientific) truths, the divine truth can be comprehended by individuals - prophets and saints. Secular truth is realised with the help of the mind, the scientific way.</p>

        <p>In the ideological struggle of the Mu&#39;tazilis and the Mu&#39;takallim, the narrative (qalom) of Abu Hamid al-Ghazali was formed. The philosophy of Islam emerged. In some Arabic teachings it is called natural philosophy (philosophy of nature). Al-Ghazali was inclined to Sufi views, but later, on the basis of criticism of their teachings, he created his own Qalom. However, without wishing to do so, he theoretically substantiated the doctrine of Tasawwuf (Sufism). According to the teachings of Ghazali, man possesses free will before assimilation of the word of Allah, the Koran, and having assimilated the Koran, man&#39;s will merges with the will of Allah. All his actions, all his activities become a manifestation of the will of Allah.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;It is known that the leading direction of Oriental philosophy is aimed at purification of the soul and psyche of a man, forming in him the qualities of a perfect man, on the basis of humanization of social relations. The idea that moral wealth, moral purity, decency, conscientiousness, and not transitory wealth, rank and position are important conditions for formation of man in social understanding caused the formation and spread of Sufism in the East.</p>

        <p><strong>Sufism,</strong> a complex religious-philosophical movement, has two main lines of thought: the love of material wealth and high office, all of which leads to oblivion and loss of imon (faith). The second direction is the propaganda that people, created by Allah, should live as human beings, by their good deeds passing the way from purification to the world of Allah.</p>

        <p><strong>The Shariah</strong> is the rigorous and consistent implementation of religious rules and rituals, the moral and divine directives of the Qur&#39;an and hadiths, and the service of Allah. The Shariah provides for the knowledge and perception of God. Without adhering to the requirements of Shariah, one cannot convert to Tariqat.</p>

        <p><strong>Tariqat </strong>means the renunciation of earthly pleasures, victory over one&#39;s own desires, solitude and thoughts solely about God, love of God in the heart.</p>

        <p><strong>Ma&#39;rifat</strong> (enlightenment) is knowledge, the foundation of the world and the universe - God. According to ma&#39;rifat, all beings - humans, animals, birds, the moon, the sun - are necessities of god, and man is a particle of god and the sun.</p>

        <p><strong>Hakikat </strong>(truth) means to cognise oneself as having attained God, having seen His face, and united with Him.</p>

        <p><strong>Nakhshbandia </strong>emerged in Central Asia under the direct influence of the ideas of Yusuf Khamadani, Abduhalik Gijduvani, Najmiddin Kubro, and Khoja Ahmad Yassavi and spread widely in the Near and Middle East. Gijduwani, who started the current of Khojatatat, called for in all situations (situations) to be with science, amal (action) and also (faithfulness), to follow the steps of ancestors (solaf), to adhere firmly to Sunnat (mohalid way) and society, to learn foki (religious laws) and hadith: &quot;Eat little, sleep little, speak little. Eat honestly (extracted), get rid of doubts.&quot;</p>

        <p><strong>Khoja Ahror Wali (Ubaydullah)</strong>, propagating Naqshbandiyya, urged not to accept gifts (bribes), to master any craft to perfection, and to hate greed. There is no bad trade in Sufism for representatives of the Tariqat, the bad thing is not having a trade, being a freeloader, waiting for alms from someone. The imom (faith) of the Naqshbandi is reflected in his demand, &quot;Dil ba yoru, dal bakor&quot; (&quot;Soul to Allah, and hands in deed&quot;). By the word amal (action) they meant, first of all, keeping the name of Allah in the soul, engaging in socially useful work, and hating idleness and begging. Amir Temur, Ulugbek and other rulers of Turkistan that adopted the direction of naqshbandiya condemned the way of life of dervishes, and called them to take up the affairs of this world and to live honestly. They issued decrees that the state would create conditions for dervishes to be engaged in useful work and punished those who failed to meet this requirement. Left wing of tasawwuf as religious-philosophical doctrine, opposition to fanaticism, Islam had its place and promoted development of natural and philosophical sciences in Central Asia and Middle East.</p>

        <p>In the IX-XII centuries, agriculture, bush farming and trade developed in Central Asia, creating a need for empirical knowledge, and as a result, the advanced people of Central Asia began to study deeply mathematics, astronomy, geography and medicine. This period in the history of Central Asia is referred to as the Renaissance. The culture of the Renaissance had its own characteristics, which consisted of the following:</p>

        <p>1. The desire for secular enlightenment, using for this purpose the cultural achievements of the past and neighbouring countries, especially the active development of natural-philosophical, social knowledge;</p>

        <p>2. Interest in nature, development of natural sciences, rationalism, priority of sciences in search of truth. Truth was believed to be the basis of human imagination and knowledge;</p>

        <p>3. Exaltation of man, formation of mental, natural, artistic, spiritual qualities, humanity, manifestation of high moral qualities and rules, setting the goal - to bring up a harmoniously developed man;</p>

        <p>4. Universality-encyclopaedic, interest in everything.</p>

        <p>Since that time, the works of scholars of Central Asia began to spread all over the world, being of great importance for the development of progressive thought in Asia and Europe. The role of such illuminators as Ibn Zakariya ar-Razi, al-Kindi Muhammad Muso Khwarizmi, Farabi, Beruni, Ibn Sina, Omar Khayyam, Ulugbek, Navoi, etc. in development of philosophical thought of the Middle Ages is great.</p>

        <p>Culture developed in the central cities of the Arab Caliphate in Baghdad and Damascus in the late seventh and early ninth centuries. Much political and artistic literature was translated from Indian, Greek and Persian.&nbsp; Cultural relations were developing, and the heritage of Aristotle, Galen, Hippocrates, Archimedes, Euclid was widely studied. In early XI century, the Dor ul Hilma (House of Wisdom) was established in Baghdad and famous scholars from all over the Caliphate were invited there. Here, various sciences were developing: astronomy, geometry, mathematics, medicine, historiography, geography, chemistry, philosophy, etc.</p>

        <p>The Arab Caliphate united many peoples and tribes with different levels of social development, including the peoples of Syria, Egypt, Khorasan, Maverannahr, and peoples with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage. Arab Muslim culture was formed on the basis of the cultural heritage of the history of the Caliphate. This culture was of great importance to the Arabs as well as the Arabised nations. The non-arabified peoples of the Caliphate were able to rebuild their culture, different from the Arab culture over the centuries, but it was formed as a culture within the Arab-Islamic culture.</p>

        <p><strong>Abu Nasr Farabi</strong> was born in the village of Farab on the Syr Darya, educated at home and later in Baghdad and Damascus. Farabi was one of the most famous scholars of Central Asia and entire East. He was a philosopher, linguist, logician, mathematician, astronomer, physician, psychologist, music theorist, expert in Greek science and philosophy, as well as an outstanding Aristotelian. During his lifetime he was called &quot;Al muallim as sonius&quot;, the second Aristotle. Farabi translated Aristotle&#39;s works into Arabic and wrote commentaries on them. At the same time, he wrote more than 160 unique works, including &quot;What should one know when studying philosophy?&quot;, &quot;Philosophical questions and answers&quot;, &quot;The art of verse&quot;, &quot;On the laws of poetry&quot;, &quot;On the origin of sciences&quot;, &quot;Word on music&quot;, &quot;The book on the classification of rhythms&quot;, &quot;Source of questions&quot;, &quot;On the mind&quot;, &quot;The book on human organs&quot;, &quot;Residents of the ideal city&quot;, &quot;The Book of the State&quot;, etc.</p>

        <p>Farabi calls God &quot;the first cause&quot;, &quot;the first essence&quot;. He associates him with matter by means of cause-and-effect relations. Matter possesses all the features inherent in its cause, i.e. god. Without matter, i.e. consequence, there can be no cause. The world, nature was created by God in a short space of time, the planets and the cosmos, including the earth and have a force of mutual attraction. Such theoretical conclusions of Farabi were substantiated by Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation in the beginning of XVIII century.</p>

        <p><strong>Ibn Sina</strong>, one of the outstanding figures in the science and culture of Renaissance, had written more than 400 works dealing with many areas of science. 242 of them have reached our days: 80 works are dedicated to philosophy, divinity, Sufism, 43 to medicine, 19 to logic, 26 to psychology. Due to his works, Abu Ali Ibn Sina advanced the culture of Central Asian peoples to the forefront of world culture; he was called &quot;Shaikhur Rais&quot; (Master of Scientists). The main works of the scholar are Kitobat Shifo, Danish-name, Najot (&quot;Salvation&quot;), Kitob ul Insof, Kitob al-qonun fit tib, and Laws of Medicine. &quot;Ibn Sina&#39;s Danish Namae is dedicated to the five fields of science - logic, medicine, astronomy, music and divinity (theology). Ibn Sina, like his predecessors and contemporaries, recognizes God and accepts him as the origin and source of the universe.</p>

        <p>According to Ibn Sina, philosophy is the science of Being. Being is eternal, it can change form, it can change from one form to another, but it is matter that does not disappear. In order to check this it is necessary to take as a basis the categories of necessity, possibility and cause. Thanks to these categories one may have philosophical views. In the world there are &#39;zaruriy vujud&#39; (necessary) and &#39;imkoniy vujud&#39; (possible), the first of which is the whole, independent of anything; it is the capable, intelligent, all knowing - god. The second comes from necessity - god and manifests it. This origin in the form of emanation, i.e. in the form of a ray emanating from the sun, occurs the mind, soul and body, and in connection with them the heavenly bodies. This is substance, besides it there is araz akundeniya in the world, i.e. signs, colour, volume, smell and other properties of objects. The body consists of form and matter. Nature, integrity in the material plane, develops according to its laws, natural phenomena have a causal relation and can be studied.</p>

        <p>According to Ibn Sina, bodies are made up of 4 elements: air, water, fire, earth, which are interrelated and interact with each other. From their totality, an object comes into being or it disappears. However, their basis - the 4 elements - does not change, does not disappear. Matter is closely related to movement, time and space. Ibn Sina&#39;s contribution to the theory of knowledge is huge. He believed that human knowledge is formed by cognition of objective objects, their causal relations. Man learns existence emotionally with the help of feelings, mentally with the help of concepts. Ibn Sina valued the role of thinking in cognition.</p>

        <p><strong>Alisher Navoi</strong> considered man to be the central image of the cosmos, the crown of all beings. He named morality, modesty, kindness, truthfulness, diligence, generosity as positive qualities of man. The main problem of his works, their defining and central issue is man, the people, the native land, its prosperity and progress. Navoi respects people who care about them and honour man and his fate.</p>

        <p>The science and culture of Central Asia developed in a peculiar way in the XVI-XX centuries, during the epoch of khanates and emirates. Feudal feud caused many calamities for scientists, but could not prevent development of science, culture and literature. The representative of this period, <strong>Boborahim Mashrab (1657-1711)</strong> took an important place in the development of social and philosophical thought of the Central Asian peoples. He believed in kalandarism, a branch of Sufism prevalent in the Middle East at that time, and sought to fight against injustice in society. In his ghazals and rubai, he extolled divine love, the love of God. At the same time, he mentions worldly concerns and human qualities to improve people&#39;s life. Mashrab reproaches the members of the clergy who do not observe the rules of Shariah, who engage in fraud and debauchery, and urges them to take the path of truth. Mahmudkhan, the hakim of Balkh, ordered the execution of the poet.</p>

        <p><strong>Mirzo Abdulkadir Bedil (1644-1721)</strong> played a prominent role in the development of socio-political and philosophical thought in Central Asia. He wrote more than 120,000 lines of poetry and 20-25 pp. of prose. His collection &quot;Kulliyot&quot; includes 16 books. Bedil&#39;s works on philosophy include Irfon (Knowledge), Chor Unsur (Four Elements), and Nukot (Sharpnesses). The basis of Bedil&#39;s philosophical thought is the recognition of the existence of an objective world. According to his teachings, nature is eternal, its objects and phenomena are interconnected, the world is always changing, developing. Bedil&#39;s philosophical views are reflected in his doctrine of the &quot;unity of being&quot;. According to him, spirit, body and soul are linked. From different combinations of the four elements, the inorganic world arose, and from it the organic world: plants, animals and human beings. According to Bedil, particles in the composition of objects, bodies change, resulting in new objects. This astonishing and mysterious phenomenon occurs out of necessity. This necessity is in the objects themselves and their relationships. According to Bedil&#39;s teachings, human senses are affected by the external world, man learns the essence of objects with the help of intellect (mind). He always stressed that the objective world is the source of knowledge. Human being perceives the influence of external world with sense organs and thinking cognises the essence of objects. Bedil&#39;s socio-political views are also important. In his poems he calls for respect for man, to think about his future, to live honestly. He criticizes the loafers, liars, proud, greedy, traitors, values modesty, generosity, industriousness, morality, imon (faith).</p>

        <p>Ideas and teachings of great thinkers on enlightenment were creatively developed by writers, historians and philosophers in XVII-XIX centuries and acquired new meaning and content. Tuldi Farogii, Mashrab, Shermuhammad Munis, Mahammad Sharif Gulhani, Muhammad Rizo Ogahi and others are prominent figures of science, scholars, poets, writers in this difficult historical period. At the end of the XIX century a new social and political direction, enlightenment, reflecting the fundamental interests, aspiration to freedom and independence, and aspirations of the working people, began to form in Turkestan. Major figures of enlightenment were Ahmad Donish (1827-1897), Furkat (1858-1909), Zavki (1853-1921), and Avaz Utar (1884-1914). Their main purpose was education and culture of the people, development of national consciousness and pride, consolidation of people on this basis, and ensuring the independence and freedom of the homeland.</p>

        <p>At the end of the ninth and beginning of the twentieth centuries a movement of Jadids was being formed with the aim of educating and raising the level of knowledge, outlook and thinking. This was regarded as a prerequisite for the attainment of national independence, and the Jadids fought tirelessly for the realization of these noble ideas. The brilliant sons of the people Mahmudkhoja Behbudi, Minavvarkary, Abdurauf Fitrat, Abdullah Avloni, Chulpan, Usman Nasir, Abdullah Kadiri and others cared for the future of Turkestan, the prosperity of the nation, and prepared the basis for national independence.</p>

        name: "Philosophy of Antiquity and Middle Ages",
        description: `<p>Origin of philosophy in ancient Greece. Pre-Socratics. It is considered that ancient philosophy emerged in the first half of VI century B.C. in Miletus, in the Asia Minor part of Ionia, then part of Hellas. That is why the first Greek philosophical school is considered to be Miletus. Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes and their disciples belonged to it. The first Greek philosophers are also called naturophilosophers, because their subject was nature.</p>

        <p>According to Diogenes of Laertes, Thales was the first to discuss nature, and he held water to be the starting point. According to Aristotle, for Thales water is the beginning, the basis and the end of all things. According to Aetius, Thales was the first to suggest that the nature of the soul is that it is in perpetual motion or self-motion and that everything in the world is animated. One of the most famous sayings of Thales that has come down to us is &quot;Know thyself&quot;.</p>

        <p>Anaximander is a disciple and follower of Thales. He wrote his philosophical work On Nature, of which some fragments have come down to us. Anaximander (according to Simplicus) was the first to call the beginning what lies at the base. He found such a beginning in a certain apeiron. The apeiron is the beginning and basis of all things. The word &quot;apeiron&quot; means limitless, boundless, infinite.</p>

        <p>Nearly all ancient authors agree that the apeiron in Anaximander means matter (e.g. Aetius). Simplicus believes that, observing the transformation of the four elements (earth, fire, water and air) into each other, Anaximander did not consider it possible to take one of them as a basis, but took as his (the basis) something different from them.</p>

        <p>Anaximander was a disciple and follower of Anaximander. His views were narrower than those of his teacher, and so, unable to hold on to the height of Anaximander&#39;s abstract thinking (apeiron), Anaximenes found the origin of all things in one of the four elements - air. Anaximenes called air infinite. It is not difficult to guess that Anaximander&#39;s apeiron was here transformed into the property of air.</p>

        <p>Anaximenes reduced all forms of nature to air. Everything arises from air through its rarefaction and condensation. Diluting air becomes first fire, then ether, and condensing air becomes wind, clouds, water, earth and stone. Dilution he associated with heating, and thickening with cooling.</p>

        <p>Movement was considered by Anaximenes to be perpetual. Motion transformed all things into each other. The earth and the celestial luminaries, according to Anaximenes, float in the air. The earth, because it is flat, is stationary. If everything emerges from the air, Anaximenes believed, then the gods also emerged from it. It turns out that the gods are a kind of modification of material substance. &quot;What then is divine about them?&quot; - asked Augustine.</p>

        <p><strong>Heraclitus</strong> (c. 544 - 483 BC) was an important Greek philosopher and materialist. His main work, like that of the philosophers of the Miletus school, was called On Nature. But he was a little bit luckier as to the preservation of the work - more than 100 fragments of this work have reached us. Heraclitus&#39; style is rather difficult to understand - there are too many metaphors and comparisons. He always tried to be enigmatic (it is no coincidence that, according to Cicero, Heraclitus had a nickname of the Dark One) and he succeeded to a certain extent. Heraclitus proceeded from the idea of the changeability of all things, i.e. that everything flows and changes and that one cannot step twice into the same river. Heraclitus saw the basis of the universe in fire: &quot;The cosmos, the same for all, was not created by any god or man, but is and always will be an eternally living fire, burning up in steps and dying out in steps&quot;. Heraclitus expresses the idea of the substance of fire in comparing it with gold and things with goods, &quot;Everything is exchanged for fire, and fire for everything, just as gold is exchanged for goods, and goods for gold&quot;.</p>

        <p>The Pythagoreans played an outstanding role in the development of ancient mathematics. The founder of their eponymous union was <strong>Pythagoras</strong> himself (c.570 - BC). The central concept of the Pythagorean philosophy is numbers. Numbers are the basis of the universe. The 1, 2, 3, 4 forming the quadrilateral, or tetractis, were particularly highly regarded. Nature, in their opinion, consists of four geometric elements (points, lines, surfaces and bodies) and four elements (fire, water, earth, air). The four numbers forming the tetractis in the sum gave 10 (theory of proportions), that is why 10 was proclaimed an ideal number, and was seen as a symbol of the whole universe. If 10 is a perfect number, there should also be 10 bodies in the heavens. In order to obtain the right number the Pythagoreans invented the Central fire around which the Earth, the Sun, the Moon and the five then known planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) circulate, and also the Anti-Earth on the other side of the Central fire. Neither the Central Fire nor the Anti-Earth is visible, as we dwell on the part of the Earth that faces the opposite side from them. It is believed that Pythagoras was the first philosopher to introduce the term &quot;philosophy&quot;.</p>

        <p><strong>Empedocles </strong>(490 - 430 B.C.) in a sense continued the line of his predecessors and accepted all four elements, which he called &quot;the four roots of things&quot;, as the primary basis. They do not turn into each other. They are eternal and have no beginning. Empedocles distinguished between ordinary consciousness and attitudinal consciousness. Mundane consciousness is concerned with individual aspects of life, while philosophical consciousness is concerned with the world as a whole.</p>

        <p>Empedocles made a significant contribution to biology. He was interested in questions such as: &quot;Which came first - flora or fauna, man or animal? Empedocles proceeded from the premise that the part precedes the whole. At first, many heads grew up devoid of the back of their heads and necks, bare arms wandering around, not knowing their shoulders. But through the power of love in the world, these heterogeneous parts began to come together, forming mostly random, monstrous and unlivable compounds. Many two-faced creatures were born, humans with the face of an animal and vice versa. However, by chance some combinations turned out to be successful and these combinations survived, the rest perished. Empedocles says that there was no designer - everything happened by natural selection. As we can see, Empedocles had, to some extent, anticipated C. Darwin.</p>

        <p>Empedocles proceeded from the assumption that the like is learned by the like - earth by being related to earth, water by being related to water, etc. Empedocles also guessed the speed of light - he spoke of the very high speed of light, which we do not even have time to notice. The speed of light, as it is known, was first measured by the Danish astronomer Remer Ole Christensen.</p>

        <p>On the question of the relation to nothingness <strong>Anaxagoras (500 - 428 B.C.) </strong>adheres to the Eleates. &quot;How, for example, could meat arise from non-meat?&quot; - Anaxagoras wondered. He assumed that nothing arises from nothingness. Anaxagoras did not see how anything could arise from non-existence or go into non-existence. At the same time, he rejects the Eleatian teaching of immutability and multiplicity excluding the unity of being. Preserving the rational grain of the Eleatian teaching, Anaxagoras stresses that the expressions &#39;arising&#39; and &#39;annihilation&#39; are misunderstood by philosophers. No thing arises or annihilates, but each is made up of the displacement of existing things or is set apart in them. Anaxagoras uses &#39;mingle&#39; instead of &#39;arise&#39; and &#39;stand out&#39; instead of &#39;perish&#39;.</p>

        <p>Anaxagoras rejects the idea of the elements as a primary. It is not the elements that are primary, but all states of matter without exception. The earth is no more primary than gold, the water is no more than blood or milk. In the question of primordialism Anaxagoras - pluralist, he admits multiplicity of origin, which he calls the &quot;seed of all things&quot;. Anaxagoras belongs to the famous expression: &quot;In everything there is a part of everything&quot;.</p>

        <p>Anaxagoras talks about a special active beginning - Nus. Nus i.e. Mind is the creator of the cosmos from the primordial chaos. This world Mind at Anaxagoras both cognizes the world, and moves it. Nus is one, he acts through thinking. It is infinite and not mixed with any thing. Nous is the subtlest and purest of all things. Knowing the world, Nus has perfect knowledge of everything and has the greatest power. It determines the past, the present and the future.</p>

        <p><strong>Leucippus (c. 500 - 440 BC) and Democritus (460 - 370 BC).</strong> Epicurus denied the existence of a philosopher called Leucippus. The difficulty lies in distinguishing between the writings of Leucippus and Democritus: very little has survived of the works of both philosophers. They are called atomists because they took atoms as the originals. Leucippus and Democritus, contrary to the Eleatics, put forward the thesis that non-existence is in no way less than existence. This nothingness is empty space, i.e. emptiness. Being is the antipode of emptiness. If emptiness has no density, then being is dense. If emptiness is one, then being is multiple. Being is the totality of an infinite number of small atoms. The question arises, however - How did the atomists arrive at the fact that there are atoms? It is from a natural phenomenon: the gradual and imperceptible wiping of a gold coin, the spreading of odours, the drying of damp, etc. indicate that bodies are composed of particles inaccessible to the senses. These particles are indivisible.</p>

        <p>So, the atom is an indivisible, perfectly dense, impenetrable, void-free independent particle of matter, which is not perceptible to our senses. Atoms have different shapes - they are spherical, angular, convex, etc.</p>

        <p>Democritus and Leucippus assumed that the number of atoms is infinite. Otherwise it would be impossible to explain the infinite variety of things and phenomena. Atoms are separated from each other by emptiness. Atoms and emptiness are indifferent to each other.</p>

        <p>One of the most important properties of atoms is motion. As reported by later authors (e.g. Aristotle) &quot;atomists introduced emptiness, believing that movement is impossible without emptiness. Atoms float in emptiness like the dust particles we see in a sunbeam. When atoms collide, they change their direction of motion. It is not quite clear whether the movement of the atoms is due to a collision, or whether the collision of the atoms is due to free movement.</p>

        <p>The atoms are completely without quality, that is, they are devoid of any properties such as colour, smell, sound, etc. All these properties are created in the subject by interaction between atoms and our senses. Thus, in Leucippus and Democritus we first find the doctrine of primary and secondary qualities, which in modern times was developed by sensualists, in particular by John Locke. The primary qualities, such as shape, magnitude, and motion, are objective, i.e., inherent in atoms from the beginning. The secondary qualities - smell, colour, etc. - arise in us as a result of the interaction of atoms and the human senses.</p>

        <p>Atoms, intertwining, folding, give birth to things. The atomists explained the appearance and destruction of things by the division and addition of atoms, and the change of things by a change in their order and position.</p>

        <p><strong>Sophists. Protagoras.</strong> The ancient Greek word sophistes meant expert, master or sage, but sophists were sages of a special kind - they were not interested in truth. They taught the art of winning arguments by any means. They therefore had an amazing gift of speech. The sophists had developed a science of words. In philosophy they drew attention to the problem of man, society, the nature of knowledge. In gnoseology they raised the question of how our thoughts about the world around us relate to it. The sophists taught that each person has his own truth: as it seems to someone, so it is. For them there is no objective truth as such, only subjective truth. Therefore, the sophists were agnostic. Their world outlook was characterized by a kind of relativism, which was directed also against religious dogmas, because it demanded proof for this or that position.</p>

        <p>The sophists, by their attitude to philosophy as a techneme, to a certain extent devalued the idea of wisdom, which was later rehabilitated by Socrates and Plato. Without them, however, philosophy would hardly have flourished.</p>

        <p>Running ahead, let us note that no great philosopher in history has ever shared the above understanding of philosophy and that all more or less significant philosophers preferred either the sophistic or the epistemological direction of philosophy. The sophists, perhaps quite sincerely, regarded as wisdom the multiplicity of knowledge and the ability to prove and disprove anything - a kind of virtuosity of thought. The same Gorgias taught his listeners that either nothing exists, or if something does exist, it cannot be known, or if it can be known, it cannot be expressed in language, in words.</p>

        <p>An influential sophist was <strong>Protagoras (480 - 411 BC).</strong> He was a professional teacher of rhetoric and taught the art of argument. He charged money for his teaching. Protagoras wrote several works. Among them are &quot;On Being&quot;, &quot;On the Sciences&quot;, &quot;On the State&quot;, &quot;The Art of Debate&quot;, etc., but only a few fragments have survived. Protagoras justified his relativism by stating that nothing exists by itself, but exists and arises only in relation to another. On the other hand, if everything changes and passes into its opposite, then two opposite opinions are possible about every thing. Protagoras has a winged expression: &#39;Man is the measure of all things - existing that they exist, non-existing that they do not exist&#39;. Plato, in particular, explained it this way: &#39;Protagoras says that as a thing seems to me, so it is to me, and as to you, so it, in turn, is to you&#39;.</p>

        <p>It is true that already in our time Heidegger put another meaning into it: &#39;Man is the measure for the being of things&#39;, that is, the measure for all things is man himself.</p>

        <p>What, after all, guided the Sophists, and Protagoras in particular? Did they have any selection criteria? Certainly not. For them, good and evil were relative. They proceeded from personal gain.</p>

        <p><strong>Classical period of ancient philosophy</strong>. <strong>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. Socrates (469 - 399 B.C.) </strong>was an outstanding philosopher of antiquity, Plato&#39;s teacher. He is interesting not only for his teachings, but also for the way he lived, because his life was the embodiment of his teachings. It is thanks to Socrates that the word &quot;philosophy&quot; itself became common among the Greeks. Socrates&#39; philosophical method was based on three basic principles.</p>

        <p>1. <em>Irony</em> is a purifying stage, on which the philosopher frees himself from all dogmatism and imaginary knowledge, driving his mind to total self-denial. The pinnacle of this stage of knowledge is the expression &quot;I know that I know nothing&quot;.</p>

        <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Maieutics</em> - the mind purified of preconceived notions finds its kinship with the truth and, moreover, its capacity to extract it from itself by questioning. Characteristic of this stage of cognition is the expression: &quot;Know thyself.</p>

        <p>3. <em>Induction</em> - at this stage the mind, having gained certainty, advances from the particular truths found to the more general ones, covering an ever wider spectrum of being, until it reaches the last ontological foundations (to the contemplation of truth itself).</p>

        <p>The central place here is taken by the maeutics, according to which the general direction of philosophical thought towards the Absolute Truth is inward, not outward, as Socrates&#39; predecessors, the Natural Philosophers, thought. Proceeding from this Socrates took out of the bounds of philosophy the study of external nature and made the sole legitimate subject of philosophical study of the human spirit in all its manifestations.</p>

        <p>Socrates was the first European who understood that the key to unlocking all the mysteries of life, including even the mysteries of heaven, lies in the mind of an earthly man who, unknowingly, is the crown of nature and of the whole cosmos, and therefore stands closest to the Absolute. Socrates himself wrote nothing, he preached philosophy orally. Therefore everything we know of Socrates we know through Xenophon, Plato and others.</p>

        <p><strong>Plato (427 - 347 B.C.),</strong> the greatest ancient Greek philosopher of the sophistic line, was a disciple of Socrates. His services to philosophy were enormous. Firstly, by adopting philosophy from Socrates orally, Plato gave it adequate written, literary form and thus made it available to subsequent generations. Secondly, he had extended the scope of Socratic dialectics from human being to being in general, and thus he originated the first fully fledged philosophical system in the history of philosophy. Thirdly, Plato, while remaining faithful to the Socratic understanding of the Absolute as absolute good (Good) and absolute truth, supplemented this understanding with the idea of absolute beauty and thus for the first time presented in completeness the triune sophistic ideal and, therefore, the transcendental subject of any philosophy.</p>

        <p>The core of Plato&#39;s philosophy is the &quot;theory of ideas&quot; and the complementary &quot;theory of soul&quot;. Around this nucleus are built the concept of knowledge, the doctrine of the cosmos, of beauty, of man and his morality, of the state. The centre of gravitation of all the elements of Plato&#39;s doctrine is the supreme moral idea - the idea of the Good. The real existence is in the world of perception, the world of ideas, and all sensual and perceived exist as not real. Ideas do not change and therefore exist eternally, whereas things change, they are in the process of eternal becoming. Correspondingly, ideas do not arise and do not perish, whereas all that is perceptible and imperfect is constantly being born and perishing. The place of ideas is only the mind, the place of the mind is only the soul, and the place of the soul is the body. This is why the rational part of the soul is immortal, as well as the mind itself, but its irrational part, attached to the body, is born and dies and is reborn, changing bodies, moving each time after death to a new body. At the moment of death, the soul is discharged of the old body and moves for a while to the other world. The rational part of the soul, which by nature holds the truth of being, knows what and how things really are, but when it is dominated by the irrational part, the soul forgets about the real being and falls into delusion and ignorance. Therefore, cognition is the soul&#39;s recollection of what it once knew. The process of knowing is guided by Eros - inherent in the soul of man is love for the ideal: for beautiful, true and good in their fullness. The path of knowledge from vague perception to true knowledge passes upward through feeling, reason and reason; in reason is attained the direct contemplation of ideas, i.e. the truth.</p>

        <p>Plato speaks of three kinds of knowledge:</p>

        <p>- knowledge perfectly reliable without an admixture of falsehood and delusion -knowledge of ideas obtained before souls are indwelt in bodies by direct contemplation of ideas, and after indwelling in bodies by dialectical recollection;</p>

        <p>- knowledge of numbers and sciences based on them is unreliable knowledge, but it is close to it and leads to knowledge of ideas;</p>

        <p>- knowledge is imaginary, a mixture of truth and error, relying on sense perception, in which there is no truth.</p>

        <p>An important place in Plato&#39;s philosophy is occupied by the doctrine of the state, which he defines as &quot;the joint settlement of citizens&quot;. The state, according to Plato, arises as a consequence of the diversity of human needs and arising from this social division of labor, ie when everyone is engaged in his craft. The state must have farmers, builders, craftsmen, who provide them with the tools, merchants, traders and, finally, soldiers, to protect the state. Plato is negative towards the democratic form of government, i.e. the power of the majority over the minority. He gives a satirical image of the democrat - &quot;a rich blacksmith, bald, who has recently got out of prison, washed in a bath and bought himself a new cloak and is going to marry his master&#39;s daughter, taking advantage of his poverty and helplessness&quot;. Plato also hates tyranny and is negative towards oligarchy, the power of the rich, and tymocracy, the power of the military. Plato contrasts his &quot;ideal state&quot; with these four perverted types of state order.</p>

        <p>Just as the soul has three parts, so the state must have three groups of citizens, three estates. Reasonable part of soul, virtue of which is in wisdom, is class of rulers, philosophers; fierce part, virtue of which is in courage, - class of soldiers; low, lustful part of soul - class of farmers and craftsmen. This is the ideal type of state where no one disturbs anyone, everyone goes about their business.</p>

        <p><strong>Aristotle (384 - 322 BC)</strong> was an epistemic philosopher. At the age of 17 he arrived to Athens and became a student in Plato&#39;s Academy, where he stayed for 20 years, until Plato&#39;s death. Later, as it is known, Aristotle deviated from Plato&#39;s positions and developed philosophy in another - epistemological - direction. Hence the expression: &quot;Plato is my friend, but the truth is dearer&quot;. After Plato&#39;s death, Aristotle left the Academy.</p>

        <p>Aristotle, as we know, was the teacher and tutor of Alexander the Great. And as soon as Alexander became king, he decided to get rid of the philosopher as soon as possible. Aristotle had to leave. Aristotle left a huge philosophical legacy, but many of his works have not come down to us. His writings relate to various fields of knowledge - logic, philosophy, physics, biology, psychology, ethics, art, etc.</p>

        <p>Aristotle&#39;s logical teachings are presented in such works as &quot;First Analytics&quot;, &quot;Second Analytics&quot;, &quot;Topica&quot;, &quot;Categories&quot;, etc. Later, the logical works were grouped together under the general title of &quot;Organon&quot; (Instrument).</p>

        <p>Aristotle&#39;s speculative physics is reflected in such works as &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Sky&quot;, &quot;On the Origin and Destruction&quot;, etc. Biology in general is represented in such works as &quot;History of Animals&quot;, &quot;On the Parts of Animals&quot;, &quot;Movement of Animals&quot;, &quot;On the Origin of Animals&quot;, etc.</p>

        <p>Aristotle&#39;s contributions in the field of ethics are great. His ethical works such as the Nicomachean Ethics, the Eudemic Ethics, the Greater Ethics, Politics and Economics, etc., have come down to us. Aristotle did not have a work called Metaphysics. The word &quot;metaphysics&quot; has appeared thanks to Andronicus of Rhodes who undertook to systematize Aristotle&#39;s works when he placed the philosophical books of Aristotle after books on physics and, not knowing how to name them, designated by the words &quot;That which is after physics&quot; (after - in Ancient Greek meta). That is how the new word &quot;metaphysics&quot; was formed and in due course became widespread in philosophy.</p>

        <p>Aristotle distinguished first and second philosophy. The subject of the first philosophy (later called metaphysics) is not nature, but that which exists over and above it. Aristotle limited the nature by the certain framework, he does not confine it with the being and it is wider than nature which for him is only one of the genera tions of the being. So the first philosophy studies immaterial independent causes, immovable and eternal essences, etc.</p>

        <p>The subject of the second philosophy, i.e. physics, is speculative reasoning about nature.</p>

        <p>Therefore, for simplicity of understanding, the first philosophy is simply philosophy, and the second philosophy is physics. Aristotle associates supersensible, eternal and immovable entities with God, and in this sense his philosophy coincides with theology. However, &quot;God is only one of the beginnings&quot;, so Aristotle&#39;s philosophy is still wider than theology. Aristotle&#39;s philosophy studies the beginnings and causes of all things.</p>

        <p>Aristotle speaks of four beginnings:</p>

        <p>- material cause, which answers the question &quot;of what?&quot;</p>

        <p>- formal cause, answering the question &quot;what is it?&quot;</p>

        <p>- the motive cause, which answers the question &quot;where does motion begin?</p>

        <p>- purposeful reason, which answers the question &quot;for the sake of what?</p>

        <p>Aristotle splits these four causes into two groups: matter and the triune cause, since the last three causes - formal, purposive and motive - are united in God. As a formal cause, God is the receptacle of all supernatural, separate from matter, immovable, supersensible, in other words, metaphysical entities. As the driving cause, God is the prime mover, although he himself is immovable. But why is Aristotle&#39;s God immobile? If he were moving, then a force would be needed to move God himself.</p>

        <p>Aristotle defines the state as &quot;a form of dwelling of citizens, who have a certain political system&quot;, in which the philosopher distinguishes three parts: legislative, administrative and judicial. The main thing in the state is the citizen, who participates in the court and administration. In addition to the state, there are other forms of dwelling of citizens - family and village, which precede the state. The state is the aim for them. Aristotle defines man as a political being.</p>

        <p>Aristotle praises monarchy, which is a divine form of government, permissible in the presence of a superior person in the state. According to Aristotle, tyranny, oligarchy and democracy are wrong forms of government. Aristotle argues that the man who is superior to all men rises above the law as if he were a god among men. The other correct forms of state are aristocracy and republic. In aristocracy, power is in the hands of a few with personal dignity. In a republic, the state is ruled predominantly by the military.</p>

        <p>Aristotle also refers to the nature of slavery: some are slaves by nature, while others are free. It is not hard to guess that Aristotle&#39;s attitude towards slaves is quite harsh. Plato thought that, having attained a certain level of intellectual development, a slave could be free and move up to a higher class. For Aristotle, this is categorically unacceptable. It should be stressed that the classical period of Greek philosophy ends with Aristotle&#39;s philosophy.</p>

        <p><strong>Hellenistic - Roman philosophy.</strong> During the Hellenistic period the subject matter of philosophy changes towards ethical issues. We can say that Hellenistic philosophy is characterized by a certain loss of Plato - Aristotle problematics and a return to pre-Socratics. For example, Epicurus turned to Democritus, Stoics to Heraclitus and other natural philosophers, Sceptics to Sophists with their agnosticism.</p>

        <p>The main principle of Epicurus was &quot;Live unnoticed!&quot;. Epicurus wrote such works as &quot;On Nature&quot;, &quot;On Atoms and Emptiness&quot;, &quot;On the Way of Life&quot;, &quot;On the Ultimate Purpose&quot;, etc.</p>

        <p>For <strong>Epicurus (341-270 B.C.),</strong> philosophy was the way to happiness, and this was in the spirit of Hellenistic philosophy, with its ethical orientation.</p>

        <p>And Epicurus considered sensory perception to be the main criterion of truth. His mind is entirely dependent on the senses. Errors or mistakes in cognition Epicurus explained not deceptive senses, and that we wrongly judged the feelings given to us. The senses are not mistaken, it is the mind that is mistaken. Epicurus sought a natural explanation of celestial phenomena - everything that happens in the sky is fundamentally no different from what happens on Earth. Epicurus&#39; worldview is anti-mythological and anti-idealistic.</p>

        <p>Regarding atoms, Epicurus continues the line of Democritus. Atoms differ from each other in size, shape and mass. The source of motion, according to Epicurus, is in the atoms themselves. Epicurus does not need an otherworldly force - the prime mover, etc. - to explain the movement of the atoms. As their original motion the atoms have a fall in the bottomless void under the action of their own mass. In this case Epicurus states quite correctly that the falling speed does not depend on the mass of the atoms, heavier atoms do not fall faster than lighter atoms, as Aristotle thought. In Epicurus the atoms move in the void, in which there is no resistance of the medium, with the same speed, regardless of their mass. Of course, Epicurus knows nothing about the acceleration of a falling body.</p>

        <p>In the field of ethics, the teaching of Epicurus is aimed at overcoming the fear of death. According to Epicurus there is no need to fear death, because the soul has no afterlife, the soul is mortal, because like all other physical bodies it consists of atoms. On the other hand, life and death never meet each other - while we are there, there is no death, and when there is death, there is no us. We just have to live worthily on Earth. Unlike, say, a Cynic, an Epicurean will not ostentatiously beggar and despise friendship, on the contrary, he will never abandon a friend, will never leave a friend in distress, and if necessary, will die for him. The Epicurean will never punish slaves, indeed he will initiate slaves into philosophy. The Epicurean is not a fatalist. He understands that in life one thing is indeed inevitable, but another is accidental, and a third depends at all on our willpower.</p>

        <p>The second major philosophical school after Epicureanism was Stoicism, which covered a very long period from the end of the fourth century BC to the end of the third century AD. Stoicism itself comes from the Greek stoa, which means a club or hall in Athens where philosophers gathered.</p>

        <p>As a complex worldview, Stoicism combined elements of materialism, idealism, atheism and theism. Over time, idealistic motifs began to dominate, and Stoicism became a purely ethical teaching.</p>

        <p>The basic pathos of the Stoic outlook is the pathos of unity. The world is a single home, all people are citizens of the world, citizens of a single world whole. The highest aim of the people is to overcome all that separates them: ethnic, racial, social and state barriers and to merge into a cosmic brotherhood, forming a world-wide organic unity of Greeks and non-Greeks, of people and gods. We&quot;, said Zeno, &quot;should not live special cities and communities, governed by different charters, but would consider all people as fellow citizens, so that we have a common life and the same order ...&quot;.</p>

        <p>Despite a certain similarity in the views of the Epicureans and Stoics, the differences between them were much more significant: the Epicureans believed in man, his ability to arrange his life and live decently on earth, while the Stoics were characterized by fatalism, blind submission to fate.</p>

        <p>Neo-Platonism, of which <strong>Plotinus (204/205-270)</strong> was a prominent representative, completes ancient philosophy. The main thing in his philosophy is the triad: the One, the Mind and the Soul. Plotinus&#39;s world is a hierarchical structure, where each level owes its existence to a higher one. At the top of this hierarchy is the One, which is both God and good. Being the cause and origin of all that exists, the One is, nevertheless, incomprehensible. The One gives birth to everything else, and this process is called emanation - birth of the higher to the lower. The second step is Mind, the pure being generated by the One. Mind thinks, knows itself. Like the One, Mind is a timeless being. The third step is the Soul that, contrary to Omnipotence and Mind, is in time. Moreover, time itself appears due to the Soul. The soul is the source of all motion, excitements and passions. Below the soul there is the body which, thanks to the soul, gets the form. The worst properties of the body - lifelessness, inertness, sluggishness, etc., are connected with matter, which Plotinus identifies with non-existence. Matter, according to Plotinus, is the source of evil.</p>

        <p>So, Plotinus conceives of man as a connection of the divine Mind with the inert, sluggish body through the Soul, and in this sense, man&#39;s task is to get rid of all material, corporeal things and attain mental, elevated knowledge. In this case man is able to attain a state of ecstasy, i.e. a tranquillity, in which the soul remains outside the body. The human soul dissolves into God as the One.</p>

        <p>The teachings of Plotinus, and of Neoplatonism in general, had a considerable influence on the medieval Christian worldview and through it penetrated into the philosophical thought of the Renaissance and even the New Age.</p>

        name: "Major philosophical problems of medieval scholasticism. The problem of the relationship between faith and reason. Nominalism and realism.",
        description: `<p><strong>Medieval philosophy</strong> is a long and substantial phase in the history of world philosophy (V-XV centuries). The first phase of medieval philosophy is realized in patristics (teaching of Church Fathers). The foundations of Christian dogmas were laid down during that period. Among the most prominent thinkers of that time are Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and others.</p>

        <p><strong>Augustine (354-430)</strong> was an outstanding medieval philosopher and theologian. Augustine&#39;s search in philosophy was not so much for knowledge as for consolation. Neither scepticism nor stoicism could satisfy him. Closer to him in spirit was Neo-Platonism. But he also turned out to be weak - Augustine needed a stronger drug, and he became a Manichaean and stayed in this state for about 8-9 years until he found himself in Christianity. Becoming a bishop, Augustine moved completely away from the pagan philosophical tradition. Augustine developed the doctrine, already outlined by Christian theology, of the creation of nature by God out of nothing by an act of his free will. God is the genetic and substantive origin of all things. As creator of nature, God is the source of the natural order.</p>

        <p>The soul, while not existing in space, exists in time. If the soul does not have parts, it does, however, have abilities: mind, will and memory.</p>

        <p>Augustine is a voluntarist. His conversion to Christianity was an act of the will, not of reason. No wonder he argues that the will is superior, superior to reason. The supreme act of the will is an act of faith. Consequently, faith is also superior to reason. According to Augustine, the act of the will must precede the act of knowledge, cognition. Man must first believe in and love God and then try to know him. &quot;Believe in order to understand,&quot; said Augustine.</p>

        <p>Man, according to Augustine, is not free. He is not free to do anything. Everything is of God. Man is not free even in his faith. Faith is a gift from God. God is not only the creator of nature, of human souls, but also the source of goodness. God is the highest good. So where does evil come from in the world? Evil is the consequence of Adam&#39;s violation of the divine commandments. Evil is man&#39;s rebellion against God, creature against creator.</p>

        <p>An important place in medieval philosophy is occupied by the period of scholasticism (Latin for &quot;school&quot;). Its most important problems were universalism and the debate on proofs of the existence of God. The teaching of <strong>Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)</strong> stands out in this respect. He created a universal system of Christian philosophy and theology. The thinker formulated the classical statement that religion and philosophy have different ways of reaching the truth, but that there can only be one truth and that it comes from God. Philosophy, according to Thomas Aquinas, is the servant of theology.</p>

        <p>Thomas Aquinas, on the premise that there is nothing in the intellect that was not there before in the senses, argues that all intellectual cognition, which is within human capacity, draws its contents from the material received from the senses. Thomas puts forward a justification for the unity of sense and intellectual cognition, namely the ontological one. It is the principle of co-creation.</p>

        <p>The human soul is endowed with intelligence precisely because it is co-constituted with a higher than it intellectual organ, that is, the active intellect, which assists it in intellectual cognition.</p>

        <p>The intellect performs three main operations in the process of intellectual cognition:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the creation of concepts;</li>
          <li>connecting and disconnecting;</li>
          <li>&nbsp;reasoning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is the third function that the intellect performs, i.e. it binds judgements together into a definite course of reasoning.</p>

        <p>Thomas Aquinas put forward five proofs for the existence of God.</p>

        <p><em>The proof from motion,</em> nowadays called the kinetic proof, proceeds from the fact that things are in motion and that everything that moves is set in motion by something else. However, the chain of motors cannot be infinite, so there has to be a prime mover. And that is God.</p>

        <p><em>The proof from the producing </em>cause states that there is a definite causal order in the material world originating from the first cause, i.e. God.</p>

        <p><em>The proof from necessity and chance proceeds</em> from the fact that in nature and society there are single things that come into existence and are destroyed or may or may not exist. In other words, these things are not something necessary and therefore have an accidental character. It is inconceivable, according to Thomas, that these kinds of things exist always, for what may exist at times does not really exist. It also follows that if any things may not exist, then once they did not exist in nature, and if so, it is impossible that they should arise by themselves. &quot;Therefore it is necessary to put some necessary essence,&quot; writes Thomas, &quot;necessary in itself, having no external cause of its necessity of all others; by all accounts this is God.</p>

        <p><em>The proof from degrees of perfection proceeds</em> from the premise that different degrees of perfection are manifested in things in the form of being and nobility, goodness and beauty. According to Aquinas, different degrees of perfection can only be spoken of in comparison with something most perfect. Consequently, there must be something that is the truest and noblest, the best and the highest or something that has the highest degree of being. &quot;It follows,&quot; writes Thomas, &quot;that there is some essence which is to all essences the cause of goodness and of all perfection; and we call it God.</p>

        <p><em>The proof from the divine leadership of the world proceeds</em> from the fact that in the world of both intelligent and unintelligent beings, as well as in things and phenomena, there is an expediency of activity and behaviour. Thomas believes that this does not happen by chance and that someone must be directing the world purposefully. &quot;Consequently, there is an intelligent being who assumes a purpose for everything that happens in nature, and this we call God,&quot; wrote Aquinas.</p>

        <p>The main currents of thought in European philosophy in the Middle Ages were nominalism and realism. Realism argued that general concepts (universals) had real existence and preceded the existence of singular things. In this respect realism continued Plato&#39;s line in solving the problem about the relation between the concept and the objective world, the general and the singular. Its most prominent representatives were <strong>Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109)</strong> and <strong>Guillaume of Champot (1068-1121)</strong>. Thomas Aquinas was also a member of this movement. According to nominalism, only individual things can have real objective existence, while general concepts (universals) are only names (or names - nomina, hence, actually, the name of the whole movement). <strong>Roszelin (1050-1120)</strong> was at the origin of this philosophical movement. Nominalism was further developed in the philosophy of <strong>W. Occam (1300-1347),</strong> who denied the objectivity of the existence of the common beyond human consciousness. In the history of philosophy, the so-called &quot;Occam&#39;s razor&quot; is widely known. Most often it is expressed by the words: &quot;Without necessity one should not assert many things&quot;. The most common formulation is &quot;What can be explained by means of less should not be expressed by means of more&quot;.</p>

        name: "Philosophy of the Renaissance and Modern Age",
        description: `<p><strong>Dante Alighieri (1265-1321)</strong> was at the origin of Renaissance philosophy. He wrote such works as The Divine Comedy, The Oratory, The Monarchy, etc. He is considered to be the last poet of the Middle Ages. He is considered the last poet of the Middle Ages and at the same time the first poet of the Modern Age. Dante was an outstanding thinker, laying the foundations of a new humanistic doctrine of man. In Dante&#39;s worldview, man occupies an intermediate position between the corrupt and the imperishable, and thus is a member of both natures. Dante&#39;s break with the medieval philosophical tradition was evident in this dual purpose of man.</p>

        <p>A higher, extraterrestrial beatitude as the goal of human existence does not require renouncing the earthly attainable human beatitude. Two paths respond to the two kinds of beatitude: philosophical precepts and spiritual precepts. One way is open through the human mind, the other through the &quot;holy&quot; Spirit. To attain the two beatitudes requires dual guidance - the earthly destination of man is realised in the civil community, according to the precepts of philosophy, under the guidance of the secular ruler - the emperor; to life eternal life, based on revelation, is led by the Church, headed by the high priest.</p>

        <p>Many credit <strong>Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374)</strong> with the beginnings of Renaissance humanism. Petrarch was aware of his mission as a humanist and built his life in defiance of traditional canons and forms. Petrarch vigorously rejected scholasticism, which to him was the embodiment of folly and nonsense. The example of true philosophy is the work of ancient Greek philosophers. Petrarch rejects the theocentrism of medieval scholasticism; his philosophy ceases to play the role of the servant of theology. &quot;Theology, the cognition of God, is no business of men at all, this matter shall be submitted to the angels,&quot; Petrarch said. The inner world of man, and new man at that, breaking ties with medieval traditions, is the subject of Petrarch&#39;s intense interest. His earthly concerns are man&#39;s first duty and should never be sacrificed to the bliss of the afterlife.</p>

        <p>The ideology of Renaissance humanism becomes the philosophical thought of the age, winning back the right to be philosophy in the struggle with scholasticism. Humanists were not professional philosophers. Chairs and theologies of universities remained for a long time in the hands of representatives of traditional knowledge, scholastics, theologians, etc.</p>

        <p>Humanism emerged and developed outside this tradition - in various circles, societies, etc. The humanists themselves were called philosophers, although no one ever gave them any title. <strong>Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)</strong> is associated with a new way of looking at philosophical questions. He defiantly called himself an &quot;uneducated man&quot; and thus showed his rejection of scholastic ideas. Not the repetition of the past, not the commentary of problems with centuries of tradition, but a fresh look at the world, a desire to study the facts - that is Leonardo&#39;s field of activity. The main source of our knowledge is observation and experience.</p>

        <p>Declaring that all our knowledge begins with the senses, proclaiming the main source of knowledge is experience, Leonardo da Vinci firmly rejects other knowledge, not based on the direct study of nature, whether it is obtained from revelation and from scripture, the knowledge of theologians, whether it is a book, based on the authority, the knowledge of scholastic science. Knowledge that is not based on perception and experience cannot claim to have any credibility, which is the main feature of true science. Theology has no real support in experience and therefore cannot claim to possess the truth.</p>

        <p>Published in 1543, Copernicus&#39; book &quot;On the rotations of the heavenly spheres&quot; not only defined the scientific revolution of the 16th century, but also played a decisive role in the radical revision of the philosophical view of the world. Instead of geocentrism, which existed for many centuries, Copernicus proclaimed heliocentrism, which led to the desacralization of the cosmos, to a radical revision of the entire physical picture of the world. Above all, the hierarchical structure of the universe was being destroyed.</p>

        <p>According to the Copernican picture of the world &quot;the world is spherical, immeasurable and similar to infinity, there is a sphere of fixed stars, and all other celestial bodies have a circular motion, and the Earth has some rotations&quot;. In this concept, for the first time in the history of science abolished the physical and theological opposition between earth and heaven: the earth was considered as one of the heavenly bodies, the laws of motion are the same for the earth and the other planets. The Earth was not in opposition to the planets and stars, but formed a single universe with them.</p>

        <p>Pantheistic Natural Philosophy of <strong>Giordano Bruno (1548-1600)</strong> was the highest point of philosophical thought of Renaissance, it most fully and deeply embodied the main trends and characteristics of Renaissance philosophy - its humanistic pathos, elemental dialectic, a keen sense of beauty and grandeur of nature. The central category of Bruno&#39;s philosophy is the One (Uno). Bruno does not regard the &quot;One&quot; as the highest level of cosmic hierarchy of being, from which comes the descent or emanation. The one is both the cause of being and the very being of things, in it their essence and existence are identified. &quot;The universe is one, infinite and immovable,&quot; asserted Bruno. It is neither born nor destroyed. The universe is not created; it exists forever and cannot disappear. There is unceasing movement and change, but the universe itself is at rest. The god of Christian and other religions has no place or business in it.</p>

        <p><strong>Peculiarities of New Age philosophy.</strong> An extremely important role in the formation of New Age philosophy and science was played by the Reformation, which brought significant changes in the general spiritual atmosphere and economic life in Western Europe. Protestantism criticised the Catholic Church and its characteristic principle of hierarchy. In Calvinism, especially among its English followers, the struggle against the hierarchical principle that dominated the medieval worldview was fiercest. Recognising no need for intermediaries between man and God, and thus rejecting the hierarchy of church authorities, Protestants stressed that God spoke directly to each person and just as directly governed the universe, without the need for a host of heavenly ranks - angels and archangels, vehicles of the divine will in the world.</p>

        <p>The antithesis of faith and knowledge, characteristic of Protestantism, led to a conscious desire to limit the scope of reason to the world of &quot;earthly things&quot;, since the transcendent God, according to Protestant theologians, is exclusively the object of faith, not knowledge. By &quot;earthly things&quot; was understood first and foremost a practically oriented knowledge of nature. Hence the respect for all labour - both peasant and artisan, both earth-maker and entrepreneur. This explains the characteristic Protestant recognition of the special value of technical and scientific inventions, of all kinds of improvements which help to facilitate labour and stimulate material progress.</p>

        <p>The emergence of experimental-mathematical natural science, whose first steps can be traced at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries in the work of J. Kepler, G. Galileo, F. Cavalieri and others, is connected with the above-mentioned circumstances. Already in 17th century the new science of nature in many respects determined the content and aims of metaphysics, and in 18th-19th centuries it repressed the latter to the background, creating a special scientistic way of thinking and life orientation, which till now determines the character of European culture and industrial-technical civilization, which is now global.</p>

        <p>These peculiarities of the New European culture also gave rise to a new orientation of philosophy. Whereas in the Middle Ages it acted in alliance with theology, and in the Renaissance - with art and humanitarian knowledge, since the seventeenth century it has relied mainly - though certainly not exclusively - on science. Therefore, to understand the problems faced by philosophical thought in XVII-XVIII centuries, we have to take into account the specifics of the new type of science about nature, the foundations of which were laid exactly in that period and which differed essentially from the natural science of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. And since science takes the leading place in worldview of this epoch, in philosophy the problems of the theory of knowledge - gnoseology come to the fore, although initially gnoseology is still grounded by ontological assumptions.</p>

        <p>The problem of the reliability of knowledge: empiricism and rationalism. A characteristic feature of New Age philosophy was the struggle between empiricism and rationalism. Empiricism relied mainly on inductive (experimental) cognition of the world, while rationalism adopted deductive-rationalistic method of comprehending the reality.</p>

        <p>An important place in New Age empiricism is occupied by <strong>F. Bacon (1561-1626). </strong>He compared method with a lamp lighting the way in the dark, and believed that you can not count on the success in the study of questions, or any other way, going the wrong way. Bacon strove to create a method that would act as an &quot;organon&quot;, i.e. an instrument of knowledge. Bacon developed the inductive method, the essence of which is as follows:</p>

        <p>a) the collection and accumulation of empirical data;</p>

        <p>b) the inductive synthesis of the accumulated data with the formulation of hypotheses and models;</p>

        <p>c) testing hypotheses by experiment on the basis of the deductive method - logically correct inference from an axiomatic assumption, the correctness of which cannot be proved by the hypothetico-deductive method;</p>

        <p>d) rejection of unsuitable models and hypotheses, and the formation of appropriate theories.</p>

        <p>Bacon&#39;s methodology of scientific enquiry requires the removal of so-called idols (ghosts) from human thinking. These are partly inherent in the human mind by nature, partly emerged in the course of the individual development of man and partly in the process of cognitive activity. Bacon distinguishes four varieties of idols:</p>

        <p>1) Idols of the genus are intrinsic to human nature itself, both to the mind and to the senses. These idols, according to Bacon, cannot be completely eradicated, but they can be neutralised by slowing down their harmful effects on man as much as possible.</p>

        <p>2) Idols cave in when, for example, a person is guided by his subjective feelings. In this case, he rather believes in the truth of what he himself prefers. Overcoming this idol, according to Bacon, can be done collectively - collective experience corrects individual experience.</p>

        <p>3) The idols of the square are generated by people&#39;s speech communication. But people&#39;s speech is often incorrect and mistaken. Manipulating with words, we should not forget that the hundred percent objectivity of existence belongs first and foremost to the things themselves.</p>

        <p>4) Idols of theatre are generated by blind faith in authorities, including traditional philosophical systems and doctrines, whose artificial construction constitutes a kind of &#39;philosophical theatre&#39;.</p>

        <p><strong>R. Descartes (1596-1650) </strong>was at the origin of the rationalist philosophy of the New Age. &quot;All philosophy is like a kind of tree, the roots of which are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches proceeding from this trunk are all the other sciences, reduced to three main ones: medicine, mechanics and ethics&quot;. Whereas Bacon drew on the empirical sciences, Descartes proceeds from metaphysics, i.e. philosophy.</p>

        <p>Descartes defined nature as an extended substance, distinguishing it from a thinking substance, i.e. he adhered to a dualistic conception of the universe. Substances are defined through their opposition to each other: mind is an indivisible substance, body is a divisible substance. The first (mind) constitutes, according to Descartes, the subject of metaphysics, the second (body) constitutes the subject of physics, i.e. mechanics. In order to consistently divide all things into two substances, Descartes had to eliminate the reality that made it possible to bridge the gap between mind and body: the soul. Animals, let alone plants, are no longer endowed with any soul, but are automatons, just as the human body is. The latter is &quot;a machine which, being made by the hands of God, is incomparably better arranged and has in itself movements more marvellous than any of the machines invented by men&quot;.</p>

        <p>Descartes called method &quot;precise and simple rules&quot;, the observance of which leads to an increase in knowledge and makes it possible to distinguish false from true knowledge. He developed the rules of the rationalist method, among which the first is the requirement to accept as truth only those statements which are clearly and distinctly understood. Axioms are taken as starting points as self-evident truths, perceived by the mind intuitively, without any proof; from directly recognisable statements new knowledge is deducted by deductive proof.</p>

        <p>The Cartesian method is based on four rules.</p>

        <p>1. It is required to accept as true everything that is perceived in a very clear and distinct way and does not give rise to any doubts, i.e. is quite self-evident. We have before us an indication of intuition as the initial element of knowledge and the rationalist criterion of truth. That which is intuitive is certain, and all that which does not fall under intuition is subject to doubt and cannot be regarded as true. As a criterion of truth, intuition is a state of mental self-evidence.</p>

        <p>2. To divide each of the parts in question into simpler components and thus reach the simplest, clearest and most self-evident things, i.e. to that which is directly given already by intuition. In other words, analysis aims at discovering the initial elements of knowledge. This second rule of Descartes led to two results which were very important for the research practice of the 17th century:</p>

        <p>a) As a result of analysis, the researcher has objects which are already amenable to empirical scrutiny;</p>

        <p>b) The philosopher-theorist discovers the universal and therefore simplest axioms of meaning about reality, which can already serve as the beginning of a deductive cognitive movement.</p>

        <p>3. In cognition by thought one must proceed from the simplest, most accessible to us things to the more complex and correspondingly difficult to understand things.</p>

        <p>4. Everything must be enumerated, reviewed, so as not to lose sight of anything.</p>

        <p>Descartes put forward the principle of methodological doubt, the essence of which is that one may doubt everything, the existence of the world, even one&#39;s own existence, but the very act of doubting cannot be questioned. Hence his famous thesis - Cogito ergo sum, i.e. &#39;I think, therefore, exist&#39;.</p>

        <p>Descartes believed that human cognitive activity is composed of three types of ideas: 1) ideas received by man from outside as a result of direct contact with objects of the external world; 2) ideas formed in man&#39;s mind; and 3) innate ideas. The most valuable for Descartes are the innate ideas, to which he attributed extension, figure, motion, unity, duration, God, being, etc.</p>

        <p>In contrast to Descartes&#39; rationalist methodology, <strong>T. Hobbes (1588-1679)</strong> developed the principles of empiricism in the vein of Bacon. Hobbes is a typical representative of classical nominalism, according to which only singular things have real existence, and general concepts (universals) are only names of things. All knowledge, therefore, has as its source experience; only one kind of experience, according to Hobbes, is perception or primary knowledge, and the other is knowledge of the names of things. The source of the second experience is the mind, whose primary function is the ability to name things and to connect names, i.e. the correct use of words. Hobbes divided philosophy into two kinds - 1) Philosophy of the Study of Nature and Philosophy of the Study of State. The philosophy of nature is subdivided into the first philosophy, which studies bodies and their motion, and other private sciences of nature - geometry, physics, etc. Philosophy of State is subdivided into ethics and politics. Hobbes regarded mathematics as a model of science, whose truths he tried to link not with sense experience, but with words of human language. As a nominalist, Hobbes in fact identifies thinking with language, which is another kind of experience, the source of which is the human Mind. Thousands of thoughts that arise in a person&#39;s mind would quickly disappear if they were not anchored in words. Words translate internal speech into external speech, making it possible for people to communicate with each other.</p>

        <p>Hobbes&#39; nominalism leads to a peculiar interpretation of the problem of substance, matter, space and time. Since substantiality belongs to singular things, the notion of abstract substance becomes meaningless. This applies equally to both material and spiritual substance. Space Hobbes understands space as an abstract receptacle of bodies and similarly time exists in thought.</p>

        <p>On the question of God, Hobbes is a deist. But unlike Descartes, who accepted the ontological proof of the existence of God, Hobbes leaned towards the cosmological argument, going back to Aristotle: the world chain of causality must have a prime cause.</p>

        <p>In his anthropological views, Hobbes assumes that man, as an egoistic being, thinks about his own personal gain. Hobbes sees man as an intermediary between nature and society. And in this sense man is not just a body among many other bodies, but a rational being living in society. He is the subject of morality and politics.</p>

        <p>Hobbes distinguishes and analyses in detail two states of people - 1) natural and 2) social. The thinker calls the natural state of people a state of &quot;war of all against all&quot;, when &quot;man is a wolf to man&quot;. In this state, people are seized by fear for their lives, and they decide to move to a social state, concluding a social contract.</p>

        <p>On the question of freedom and necessity Hobbes is inclined to the conclusion that free will as such does not exist. A person may be free in one respect and unfree in another. But at the same time Hobbes understands freedom very broadly, applying it also to animals and even to inanimate objects. The water of a river, for example, not only has freedom, but also the need to flow in its course, which shows that in Hobbes&#39;s philosophy freedom and necessity are compatible.</p>

        <p>In the philosophy of <strong>Benedict Spinoza (1632-1677)</strong> Descartes&#39; two substances (material and spiritual) are transformed into one single substance. Spinoza distinguishes three properties of the substance - 1) the substance exists; 2) the substance is independent and 3) the substance is infinite. Substance is the highest reality, and there is nothing outside of it, as substance contains within itself everything that exists. Being singular, substance is indivisible. Spinoza identifies substance with both nature and God. Hence the central concept of his philosophy is God or substance or nature.</p>

        <p>This philosophical position of Spinoza represents a naturalistic pantheism which is opposed to creationism in all its forms. God, because he is dissolved in nature, has no creative functions.</p>

        <p>Spinoza distinguishes three levels of cognition: 1) intuitive; 2) demonstrative and 3) sensual.</p>

        <p>Spinoza regarded the intuitive level as the highest level of cognition, because substance is cognized through intuition. The demonstrative level allows by deduction to deduce from the concept of substance the knowledge about its attributes. On the lower, sensual level we get knowledge of facts and individual things.</p>

        <p>Spinoza proceeds from the fact that everything in the world is rigidly determined, that &quot;in the nature of things there is nothing accidental&quot;. Man, as part of nature, acts within the framework of natural laws. His nature, as it was with Hobbes, is selfish - man thinks only of personal gain. Spinoza speaks of free necessity, which follows from the definition of God-substance as the cause of itself. Freedom as a knowledge of necessity we get through an intuitive level of knowledge.</p>

        <p>Spinoza&#39;s ethical teaching, which is dominated by naturalism on the one hand and determinism on the other, does well without the participation of the Christian God as the source of moral values. A pantheistic God is indeed difficult to pray to, and from these positions the Bible is of no value for the purpose of finding truth, which lies entirely within the competence of reason.</p>

        <p><strong>H. Leibniz (1646-1716)</strong> also made an important contribution to the rationalistic philosophy of the Modern Age. His philosophical work generally developed in line with the rationalistic methodology of XVII-XVIII centuries, which was characterised by the convergence of ontology and epistemology. The rules of rationalistic method developed by Leibniz include 4 basic principles: 1) principle of universal distinctions; 2) principle of identity of indistinguishable; 3) principle of continuity; 4) principle of monadism.</p>

        <p>The principle of universal distinctions says that everything in the world is diverse - &quot;there is absolutely nowhere a perfect resemblance&quot;. According to the principle of identity of indistinguishable, two things in which all properties of the first are inherent in the second and all properties of the second are inherent in the first, are absolutely identical, i.e. they represent the same thing. &quot;To suppose two things indistinguishable is to suppose the same thing under two names,&quot; writes Leibniz. This principle, being essentially formal-logical, provides the universality of the first principle - the principle of universal differences - there are no two identical things, and if there are, they represent one and the same thing.</p>

        <p>Thus we find that the world is a set of self-identical but at the same time different things. The question arises: what is the difference between them? The answer we get from the third principle, the principle of continuity, according to which &#39;things ascend upwards in degrees of perfection in imperceptible transitions&#39;. This principle enabled Leibniz to put forward a number of interesting ideas in the field of limits in various fields of knowledge. For example, a straight line is the limit of curves and a geometric point is the limit case of minimal segments. But at the same time, the principle of continuity has led to erroneous conclusions in the field of epistemology: ignorance can dialectically pass into knowledge, falsehood into truth. It turns out, for example, that delusion is the minimum degree of truth or evil is the least good, etc.</p>

        <p>The fourth principle - the principle of monadicity - indicates that the objects of the world are purely individual and have a qualitative variety. Leibniz had substantially enriched formal logic by adding a fourth law, the law of sufficient reason, the essence of which is that every statement, a statement of thought must have a sufficient basis for that. Unlike Spinoza, Leibniz adheres to a pluralistic structure of the universe: the world consists of a multitude of substance-monads. The monads are a kind of ideal building blocks of the universe. They are simple, devoid of any parts. Monads are &quot;points&quot;, but not spatial points at all, but &quot;metaphysical&quot; points. Some of the monads have memory, which allows them to be identified with souls. The supreme monad is God.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English sensationalism. Proposing the thesis &quot;There is nothing in the mind that has not previously been in the senses&quot;, <strong>J. Locke (1632-1704)</strong> criticises Descartes&#39; theory of innate ideas. Locke declares that all knowledge is experiential. Even formal-logical laws, such as the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction, are not inborn. They are known neither to children, nor to the insane, nor to many uneducated people. Then why should they be considered innate? Behind all these general principles there are experiences which are more or less unconsciously accumulated.</p>

        <p>The process of knowledge, according to Locke, is characterised as an ascent from simple ideas to complex ones. Simple ideas of external experience are divided into two groups, different in their content: ideas of primary and ideas of secondary qualities. Only ideas of primary qualities, from Locke&#39;s point of view, give us true knowledge of real things, while ideas of secondary qualities are subjective.</p>

        <p>Cognition is true only insofar as ideas are consistent with reality. Locke also drew attention to the activity of the subject in the cognitive process. Cognition is divided into intuitive (higher), demonstrative and sensitive cognition, the latter being assessed by Locke as the least authentic (lower), which introduces a rationalist element to Locke&#39;s concept.</p>

        <p>At the heart of the views of <strong>John Berkeley (1685-1753)</strong> is the nominalist principle: &#39;everything that exists is singular&#39;. This means that nothing corresponding to reality can be non-unique and abstract concepts are false. Berkeley speaks of general and abstract ideas. General ideas exist and are perceived by us visually. For Berkeley, only that which is perceived or imagined is real, but not that which is conceivable. He reduces the concept to the representation, the rational to the empirical, the general to the particular. The distinction between sensual and rational forms of cognition disappears, and the higher of them, which makes it possible to penetrate into the essence of things, dissolves in the lower one. Berkeley, on the one hand, identifies the properties of things with the perceptions of these properties, and on the other hand, he posits perceptions as the only reality, considering things, objects of the world as combinations of these perceptions. Hence his famous position: &quot;To exist is to be perceived&quot;. Thus, Berkeley&#39;s position is that of subjective idealism. For him only secondary qualities exist.</p>

        <p><strong>D. Hume (1711-1776) </strong>proceeds from the fact that the whole cognitive experience consists of 1) impressions and 2) ideas. Impressions, which are sensations, emotions, affects, etc., enter our consciousness with the greatest force and irrepressibility. Ideas, on the other hand, are weak images of these impressions in thought. Both impressions (sensations) and ideas come in simple and complex forms. Complex ideas, for example, are formed by associating simple impressions and ideas. Hume distinguishes three kinds of associative relations: 1) by similarity; 2) by contiguity in space and time; and 3) by causation. According to Hume, all our sensations are mediated by practical activity, by complex psychological and physiological processes. &quot;Nature,&quot; Hume wrote, &quot;keeps us at a respectful distance from its mysteries and grants us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities. Hume rejects the existence not only of material substance but also of spiritual substance, taking a position of agnosticism on the matter.</p>

        <p>One of the main problems of Hume&#39;s epistemology is the problem of induction. Hume points out certain difficulties associated with the generalization of the facts of experience. These difficulties stem from the fact that by observing certain objects and studying their properties we extend them to all similar objects. And Hume concludes that we have no real reason to believe that &#39;cases we have not yet encountered in experience are similar to those we are familiar with from experience&#39;. He attributes this to a purely psychological fact - we believe in an assumed course of events.</p>

        <p>Eighteenth-century French materialism. Philosophical thought in France in the eighteenth century was largely shaped by the Enlightenment. Almost all French philosophers of that century were Enlighteners. <strong>Voltaire (1694-1778)</strong> and <strong>Montesquieu (1689-1755)</strong> are considered to be the founders of the French Enlightenment. The Enlightenment produced a global rethinking of the worldview and the principles of the social sphere.</p>

        <p><strong>Rousseau (1712-1778) </strong>played an important role in the French Enlightenment. The object of Rousseau&#39;s criticism was primarily social inequality. Rousseau analyses the history of social relations in some detail. The first revolution in the history of these relations, according to Rousseau, had to do with the building of the home. At this stage there was the separation of families, and then of clan and tribe. This period, according to Rousseau, was the happiest in the history of mankind. The second upheaval is associated with the formation of civil society, which Rousseau severely criticises. Here, equality disappears and slavery and poverty appear.</p>

        <p>It turns out that the first person who took a plot of land and fenced it in says: &quot;This is mine&quot; - and there were simple-minded enough people to believe it - was the true founder of civil society. Thus, &quot;the inevitable consequence of the cultivation of the land was its division&quot;, and property inequality, in turn, is enshrined in political inequality, the clearest expression of which is despotism. In his work &quot;On the Social Contract&quot; Rousseau defines the system that should replace the despotic type of government. He develops a new concept of the social contract, which asks how and why man lost the freedom inherent in his natural state and what needs to be done to regain it. Rousseau develops a contractual theory of law, according to which law is based on agreements, and believes that no force creates law.</p>

        <p>In this conception he departs from his original claims and believes that the state of nature could not exist for long; the human race would perish if it did not change the way it exists. And now he does not condemn private property but advises that there should be &quot;neither rich nor poor&quot; in society. At the heart of Rousseau&#39;s conception of the social contract are two requirements:</p>

        <p>- The sovereignty of the people;</p>

        <p>- The legislative power belongs only to the people. Rousseau believed that any state</p>

        <p>- Governed by laws should be called a republic, no matter what the form of government was.</p>

        <p>Rousseau&#39;s conception of the social contract is influenced by Montesquieu&#39;s &quot;geographical determinism&quot;. For hot countries, for example, despotic rule, where the power of the monarch is directed against his subjects, is &quot;lawful&quot;.</p>

        <p>Voltaire&#39;s main object of fierce criticism was reactionary clericalism. He called for it to be combated. &quot;The coming generation will owe you reason and freedom,&quot; said Voltaire, author of The Dictionary of Philosophy, The Philosophy of History and On the Soul.</p>

        <p>Voltaire largely accepts Lockean sensationalism, rejecting both Berkeley&#39;s subjective idealism and H. Leibniz&#39;s monadology. Although he criticised clericalism, he recognised the existence of God. Voltaire arrived at the idea of the existence of God on the basis of two assumptions which he regarded as undoubted truths of natural science. Firstly, the conviction that motion is not an inherent property of matter: &#39;It receives it from without, and so there is a God who communicates it&#39;. Secondly, Voltaire proceeded from a general metaphysical notion of the absolute immutability of nature; according to Voltaire, it was God who put force in the heavenly bodies, who made the planets revolve around their own axis.</p>

        <p>Later, influenced by the ideas of J. Lametr&eacute;tre, Voltaire was forced to move away from his original position on motion, and recognise that it is inherent in matter from the beginning.</p>

        <p>Voltaire&#39;s contribution to the science of history was far greater. By defining the history as &quot;narration of facts&quot;, Voltaire demanded a radical cleaning of mythological elements from the historical narrative. Voltaire was the originator of historical criticism, which became an indispensable attribute of scientific research. He put forward a number of interesting ideas about the subject of history. He demanded that the attention of historians was focused on the life of peoples, not sovereigns; he demanded historians to pay attention to all the content of the spiritual culture of peoples.</p>

        name: "German classical philosophy.",
        description: `<p>The term &quot;German classical philosophy&quot; was for the first time introduced by F. Engels and includes German philosophers of the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. - They are Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and Feuerbach. Despite considerable differences in outlook, all these thinkers had one thing in common: they all drew on the creative legacy of their predecessor, drew inspiration from his philosophy, and chose their own path of philosophical development.</p>

        <p>Classical German philosophy greatly expanded the field of research to include one of the basic philosophical teachings, dialectics. The teachings of classical German philosophy are aimed at unlocking the profound mysteries of the universe. In their &quot;planetary&quot; work, addressed to humanity, the spirit of Reason, Progress and Freedom is clearly evident.</p>

        <p>I. Kant&#39;s epistemology and ethics. There are two main periods in the philosophical work of <strong>Kant (1724-1804):</strong> pre-critical (1746-1770) and critical (1770-1797).</p>

        <p>Kant&#39;s &quot;pre-critical&quot; period was predominantly concerned with natural-scientific questions. In this period, Kant showed considerable interest in cosmology (the doctrine of the universe as a unified whole) and cosmogony (the doctrine of the origin and evolution of celestial bodies). The pinnacle of the work of this period was the famous cosmogonic hypothesis, set out in the work &quot;General Natural History and the Theory of the Sky&quot;, written in 1755.Unlike Descartes, who proclaimed &quot;Give me matter and motion&quot; and I will build the world out of them, Kant proudly declares: &quot;Give me matter and I will show you how the world should arise from it&quot;. However, Kant&#39;s natural-scientific materialism is limited, deistic in nature, because it admits the existence of God as the creator of matter.</p>

        <p>&quot;Critical&quot; Kant, on the other hand, having become disillusioned with both empiricism and the rationalism of New Age philosophy, was engaged in a serious investigation of the cognitive faculties of man. Kant was convinced that before starting the process of genuinely scientific cognition, the very instruments of human cognition and their possibilities should be investigated. Kant poses the following questions: &quot;what can I know? what must I do? what can I hope for? what is man?&quot;.</p>

        <p>Kant starts the investigation of cognitive abilities, which would allow reason &#39;to define for itself the limits of its application&#39;. In this formulation reason is understood very broadly - as the totality of all cognitive faculties of man. The word &quot;pure&quot; here means &quot;free from empirical characteristics&quot;.</p>

        <p>The characteristics of true scientific knowledge, according to Kant, are unconditional validity, universality and necessity.</p>

        <p>The cognitive faculty (reason in the broad sense of the word) has three components: sensibility, reasoning and reason. Each of these faculties corresponds to a specific question: how is pure mathematics possible? How is pure natural science possible and how is metaphysics possible? Accordingly to the three questions addressed to the three powers of cognition, Kant&#39;s epistemology is divided into three main parts:</p>

        <p>- transcendental aesthetics;</p>

        <p>- transcendental analytics;</p>

        <p>- transcendental dialectics.</p>

        <p>Transcendental analytics and transcendental dialectics together constitute transcendental logic. Kant&#39;s term &#39;transcendental&#39; means that which, although it precedes experience (a priori), is intended only to make experiential cognition possible. And &#39;transcendental&#39; means that which is beyond experience and does not apply to experience.</p>

        <p>An important place in Kant&#39;s teaching is occupied by the concept of the &#39;thing in itself&#39; or &#39;thing in itself&#39;. Kant asserts that beyond the limits of sensuous phenomena there is an unknowable reality - the world of noumens, the world of &#39;things in themselves&#39;. &quot;A thing in itself&quot; through phenomena does not appear to us - it represents the realm of unattainable ideals in general. Kant calls &#39;a thing in itself&#39; any fundamentally unknowable object that is beyond possible experience.&nbsp; Kant considers space and time as a priori (pre-experiential) forms of sensual contemplation. They are given to us independently of empirical experience.</p>

        <p>The peculiarity of Kant&#39;s ethics is that it emphasizes the primacy of practical reason over theoretical reason. The main thing for Kant is human behavior, human actions. Knowledge is valuable only if it helps man to become more human, to find a solid moral ground, to realize the idea of goodness. Only this value Kant recognizes also for faith. Faith in God for him is moral conviction, the ability to always and everywhere follow the duty. Philosophy itself has sense only insofar as it serves to educate man.</p>

        <p>In his analysis of moral concepts Kant claims that they are not deduced from experience - they are a priori, embedded in the human mind. A moral act looks like the result of some inner imperative (command) often going against the immoral practice of the surrounding reality.</p>

        <p>Strictly speaking, it is possible to see an imperative in any act. But, Kant points out, one should distinguish between imperatives aimed at achieving a certain goal and those that are not conditioned by it. He calls the former hypothetical (the deed is contingent on the goal), the latter categorical. A moral act is the consequence of a categorical imperative; one does not pursue an aim, the act is valuable in and of itself.</p>

        <p>Kant argues for an ethics that justifies acts that are moral in the highest sense of the word. These are based on the a priori laws of morality. This is the categorical imperative: &quot;Act according to such a maxim that you may at the same time wish it to become a universal law. The second formulation of the imperative reads: &#39;Act so that you always treat humanity, both in your own person and in the person of everybody else, as the end and never treat it only as the means. That is, Kant urges us to see other people not as means, but as ends. People should be judged not only by their acts, but also by the motives that motivated them in these acts. On the other hand, it is wrong to turn people into servants of duty as such, on the contrary, duty should be such that it serves the happiness of people. Being a solid pillar of morality and the source of the categorical imperative, duty gives to the act a moral character.</p>

        <p>An important place in Kant&#39;s philosophy is occupied by the problem of freedom. As the thinker himself later admitted, his main work on the theory of knowledge - Critique of Pure Reason - arose out of a desire to solve the antinomy of human freedom. Freedom exists, but where is it? In the world of phenomena we do not find it, man is free only in the world of &#39;things in themselves&#39;. Kant&#39;s dualism is a peculiar attempt to justify the ambivalence of human behavior in society, where one has to adapt to the circumstances and moral behavior requires heroism. And by the way, the problem of ideality of time, so shocking for the materialistically thinking mind, is introduced by Kant on the same grounds: time is an order of things, over which nobody has power, it is a genetic connection of states. Freedom requires the manifestation of the self-manifestation of man. Therefore if time is intrinsic to things in themselves, freedom is impossible. Only because in the integrable world there is no iron entanglement of causes and effects, no time, a causality of a special kind is possible - &#39;through freedom&#39;, which alone makes man a moral being.</p>

        <p>Kant realizes that the demands of the categorical imperative may meet serious obstacles in an empirical world where man is guided mostly by self-interest. He proposes three postulates of practical reason: 1) the principle of autonomy of will; 2) immortality of the soul and 3) God as guarantor of the first two postulates. One should also pay attention to the fact that in Kant, God is a consequence of man&#39;s morality: man is moral not because he believes in God, but because he believes in God, because he wants to become a moral being.</p>

        <p>An important consequence of Kant&#39;s categorical imperative is that it is intended to transform the history of mankind into a single teleological process: wars must be done away with and world-wide movement towards a single civil society.</p>

        <p><strong>Philosophy as a scientific doctrine by J. Fichte. Fichte (1762-1814)</strong> picked up the important idea of Kant, that philosophy should be a logically based system of statements, coming from a solid and indisputable basis. For this, he thought, it was necessary to abandon Kant&#39;s &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; and return to the tradition of New Age rationalism - Leibniz&#39;s philosophy, to derive the whole variety of cognitive forms from one spiritual substance. Such a science, and this, according to Fichte, is philosophy, is a &#39;science of sciences in general&#39; or scientism. Fichte directs the idealistic side of Kant&#39;s philosophy towards monism and objective idealism. &quot;Kant proves the ideality of objects, starting from the assumed ideality of time and space&quot;. Fichte, on the contrary, tries to &quot;prove the ideality of time and space from the proved ideality of objects&quot;. Unlike Kant, who needs ideal objects in order to fill time and space, Fichte &#39;needs time space in order to place ideal objects&#39;. By this Fichte emphasises the critical nature of his idealism, in contrast to Kant&#39;s, which in his view is dogmatic.</p>

        <p>Fichte of the Cartesian Cogito ergo sum (&quot;I think, therefore, exist&quot;) retained only the &quot;I,&quot; which manifests itself in all acts of human thought, feeling and will. It is something absolute, not subject to any doubt. Fichte tries to build his philosophical system of objective idealism around this &#39;I&#39;. &quot;The &#39;I&#39; presupposes itself, and this is the origin of the active-practical attitude to the world. In this way, &#39;self-establishment and activity... are one and the same thing&#39;. Fichte makes a normative claim for the subject who must, first of all, self-assert. However, the &quot;I&quot; cannot assert itself, since this is possible through the agency of the other, through the assumption of the &quot;not-I&quot;. The &quot;I presupposes the non-Self&quot;. The thesis (&quot;I&quot;) and the antithesis (&quot;not-I&quot;) need a synthesis, which is the &quot;I&quot;, only the indivisible, the absolute. But it is too early to find dialectics here, because the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;nonI&quot; do not change into each other, they only oppose each other. But Fichte does have some rudiments of dialectics in the system of the three foundations - the &quot;I&quot; supposes itself through the mediation of the &quot;nonI&quot;, which means &quot;without the object there is no subject&quot;. Beside the fact that the &#39;I&#39; supposes itself as definite, it also supposes itself as determinate, &quot;since the limiting element in the non-self is its own product (without the subject there is no object).</p>

        <p>With his &#39;Science Studies&#39;, which consist of a system of three foundations, Fichte declares philosophy to be the highest kind of science, which is the theoretical basis for all other sciences and the basis for human practical activity.</p>

        <p>Fichte is also known for his socio-political views, which are in many ways in line with J. Rousseau&#39;s social contract theory. Fichte saw the main and only task of society in ensuring the welfare and freedom of citizens. He was in favour of individual freedom, the right to have one&#39;s own view of the world, and full harmony between all members of society. In his views on the state, Fichte anticipated the communist idea of the abolition of the state. Proclaiming that &#39;life in the state does not belong to the absolute aims of man&#39;, Fichte defined his ultimate path: &#39;the aim of all government is to make government superfluous&#39;.</p>

        <p><strong>Natural Philosophy and Transcendental Idealism of F. Schelling.</strong> Philosophy of Revelation. The philosophical path of <strong>Schelling (1775-1854)</strong> may be represented as a movement from self-knowledge to world-knowledge, and from it to the knowledge of God, which is in accordance with the three periods of his creative path: Natural Philosophy, Transcendental Idealism and Philosophy of Revelation. His philosophy of nature reflected many of the advanced trends and ideas of the natural sciences of the New Age - the discoveries of Volta, Galvani, Ersted, Faraday and others. But Schelling interpreted these discoveries in an idealistic way: natural sciences, by providing examples, thus prove absoluteness and immutability of general philosophical truths. Hence completely absurd conclusions, such as the claim that water is the end of all chemical transformations, the interaction of electric charges takes place at an angle other than 180 degrees, etc.</p>

        <p>Alongside Natural Philosophy, Schelling develops the foundations of his &quot;Transcendental Idealism&quot; so that the philosophy of nature is supplemented by the philosophy of the spirit. The resulting philosophy of identity: Natural philosophy and transcendental philosophy share two possible lines of philosophising: &#39;That which in the real or natural world is expressed as gravitation, in the ideal world as contemplation... all this is one and the same&#39;. The identity of nature and spirit means that nature is both ideal and real. Schelling goes beyond Fichte&#39;s subjective idealism by investing nature with principles of cognition. The philosophy of nature showed how intellectual contemplation arises, but the question of how this intellectual contemplation comes to nature, in other words, the subjective beginning is joined by the objective one, is decided by transcendental philosophy. Schelling divides intellectual contemplation (intellect) into theoretical (copying) and moral-practical (assuming goals). This leads to the necessity of distinguishing between theoretical and practical philosophy within Transcendental Idealism. Theoretical philosophy answers the question of how the intellect knows the world, and practical philosophy how the intellect creates order in the world. An important place in the structure of Transcendental Idealism is occupied by the philosophy of natural aims, which carries out the analysis of the creative, purposive function of nature, and the philosophy of art, which aims to overcome the opposition between theoretical and moral-practical, conscious and unconscious activity.</p>

        <p>The philosophy of art represents the logical conclusion of the entire foundation of Schelling&#39;s philosophical building. It is in the philosophy of art, according to Schelling, that his philosophical system returns to its starting point. In aesthetic contemplation, intellectual contemplation is objectified, establishing the harmony of the object under study - the self with itself.</p>

        <p>Thus, the history of self-consciousness, according to Schelling, has passed through three stages - the theoretical self - contemplating the world, the practical self - creating order in the world, and the artistic self - creating the world.</p>

        <p>In the last years of his life Schelling wrote &#39;philosophy of revelation&#39;, which was the result of a long reflection by the philosopher on how the world emerges from the Absolute. Finding no rational explanation for this fact, Schelling turns to the realm of the irrational, the mystical, the divine. Now it turns out that all his previous philosophy (rational philosophy) was a negative philosophy of reason, which needs to be supplemented by a positive philosophy of the will. Schelling directs classical German idealism towards religion and theology, arguing that all philosophical reasoning must begin and end with God. According to the &#39;philosophy of revelation&#39;, the world of natural things is the creation of God, who is identified with the Absolute. It is accessible to knowledge through supersensible irrational contemplation. The later Schelling deals mainly with Christian religion, retelling the contents of the Bible, presenting the basic biblical myths as the highest philosophical &quot;science&quot;.</p>

        <p><strong>Hegel&#39;s Science of Logic.</strong> Hegel&#39;s doctrine of absolute, objective and subjective spirit. Hegel&#39;s conception of the philosophy of history. The philosophy of <strong>G.F. Hegel (1770-1831)</strong> represents the pinnacle of Idealist philosophy. Hegel developed the basic laws and categories of objective idealism.</p>

        <p>In his early work entitled The Phenomenology of Spirit, which completes the formation of the thinker&#39;s philosophical views, Hegel describes the development of consciousness from initial - object consciousness to absolute knowledge. In this work Hegel sketched the contours of his entire future philosophical system, the basis of which is the idealistic dialectic. In Hegel&#39;s dialectic we are not talking about the development of the real world, but about the development of a concept. So, for Hegel dialectics is the self-development of a concept: &quot;the concept itself leads on&quot;.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;Hegel&#39;s main philosophical work is &quot;Science of Logic&quot;. In general, Hegel divides science into logic, science of nature and science of spirit. Logic is the science of the pure concept and the abstract idea; nature represents the external reality of the idea, its otherness; spirit is the removal of otherness, the return of the idea to itself. These are the three parts of Hegel&#39;s Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1817), in which the thinker outlines the entire system of his philosophy. The first part (conventionally called &quot;Little Logic&quot;) repeats in abbreviated form the ideas of the main work &quot;The Sciences of Logic&quot; (conventionally called &quot;Grand Logic&quot;).</p>

        <p>In the three relations of thought to objectivity Hegel outlines the principle of the unity of the historical and logical and gives a critical assessment of the preceding philosophical trends. As the first relation of thought to objectivity, Hegel singles out the naive way of thinking, the characteristic feature of which is dogmatism. The second relation of thought to objectivity is philosophical empiricism in the person of Bacon and Locke and, in part, Kant&#39;s transcendental aesthetics. The third relation of thought to objectivity is what Hegel calls intuitionism. Hegel criticises empiricism and intuitionism for their metaphysicality.</p>

        <p>Hegel distinguishes three moments of the dialectical method. The first moment, the reasoning moment, is understood by Hegel as the initial stage of dialectical thinking. Here reasoning does preliminary work, separating the contingent from the essential.</p>

        <p>The second moment, the negative-dialectical moment, represents an intermediate stage between reason and reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the identity of the opposites is not yet recognised, but their interaction is already revealed.</p>

        <p>The third moment, the positive-dialectical or speculative moment, captures the merging, the identity of the opposites. Only here, according to Hegel, does dialectics as a method reach its maturity.</p>

        <p>By juxtaposing the three moments of the dialectical method with the three relations of thought to objectivity, we can see, according to Hegel, the bifurcation of reasoning, which has both a metaphysical and a dialectical character. After defining the triple structure of the dialectical method, Hegel proceeds to construct a system of logic, where he identifies the principle of trinity or triad, which constitutes a characteristic feature of all Hegelian dialectics: thesis - antithesis - synthesis.</p>

        <p>A proposition is put forward, followed by its negation and then the negation of the negation. Hegelian negation does not mean the destruction of the subject, but its development. Thus here we see Hegel&#39;s operation of the universal dialectical law of negation of negation.</p>

        <p>The &quot;Science of Logic&quot; consists of three parts: 1) the doctrine of being; 2) the doctrine of essence and 3) the doctrine of the concept.</p>

        <p>An important place in the doctrine of being is occupied by the description of such categories as quality, quantity and measure. Quality is a certainty identical with being, for something ceases to be what it is when it loses its quality. Quantity is a certainty indifferent to being, external to being; quantitative changes do not remove the being of the object. The house remains what it is, whether it is bigger or smaller, and red remains red, whether it is darker or lighter. But only up to a certain limit, after which there is a qualitative change. Every birth and every death is a jump from quantitative to qualitative change. True development comes only through the formation of new qualities; this is a universal principle. The dialectical law of transition of quantitative change to qualitative change is fully operative here.</p>

        <p>In the doctrine of essence Hegel emphasises the inseparable connection between such categories of dialectics as form and content: there is no formless content as well as no contentless form. In other words, form is substantial and content is formed. Speaking of essence, Hegel points out that there is no essence in &#39;pure form&#39;, it can only be found in phenomena. The essence is deeper, though the phenomenon is richer. The dialectical unity of essence and phenomenon consists in the fact that essence is and phenomenon is essential.Thus, opposites cannot exist without each other, which characterizes the presence of the third dialectical law in Hegel&#39;s system - the law of unity and struggle of opposites.</p>

        <p>In the doctrine of the concept Hegel states that not material objects, but the concept &quot;is the true first and things are what they are, thanks to the activity of the concept inherent and discovered in them&quot;. It is &quot;the progressive movement of the concept that is development&quot;. Development, according to Hegel, is &#39;the process by which only that which is already in itself is conceived&#39;, i.e. development is possible only through the germ. From the Phenomenology of Spirit we already know that the concept is always concrete, while sensuality, material objects are abstract, because they escape categorical thinking. The concept as the &#39;truly universal&#39; combines the general, the particular and the singular. Thus Hegel poses the problem of the dialectical unity of the general, the particular and the singular.</p>

        <p>In the Philosophy of Nature, Hegel views nature as &#39;a spirit alienated from itself&#39;. Philosophy of Nature is divided into mechanics, physics and &#39;organic physics&#39;, by which Hegel means biology. In Hegel&#39;s assertion that each successive stage contains inferior stages, one can see an inkling of the classification of natural processes according to the forms of motion of matter. Nature for Hegel, while not existing in time, exists in space. Hegel denied objective development in nature, which led to many erroneous conclusions and superficial assessments.</p>

        <p>&quot;Philosophy of Spirit&quot;, which explores the individual and social consciousness of people, includes the doctrine of subjective, objective and absolute spirit. In the doctrine of the subjective spirit, Hegel speaks of the formation of the human psyche and of individual and collective cognition. The doctrine of the subjective spirit breaks down into anthropology, phenomenology and psychology.</p>

        <p>Hegel expounds the doctrine of the objective spirit both in the Philosophy of Spirit and in the Philosophy of Law and the Philosophy of History. Hegel characterises the objective spirit as &#39;the present existence of free will&#39;.</p>

        <p>This includes abstract law, morality and morality. Family, civil society and state are the three stages of development of moral spirit.</p>

        <p>In his concept of philosophy of history Hegel assumes that progress in world history is always made by one nation, whose spirit is the bearer of the world spirit at a given stage of its development. The other nations are either obsolete or have not yet reached the necessary stage of development, so they play a subordinate role. At the same time, history provides each nation with one single opportunity to be at the pinnacle of world history, to play a leading role in it. Peoples, &quot;whose era is over, no longer count in world history. The aim of world history is the world spirit&#39;s knowledge of itself. Proceeding from his concept, Hegel also establishes a criterion of social progress, on the basis of which he constructs his periodisation of world history. This is progress in the consciousness of freedom. Humanity, as it develops, gradually comes to a deeper and deeper conception of freedom. The Oriental peoples do not yet know that the spirit or man is free as such; since they do not know it, they are not free; they only know that one is free, but that is why such freedom turns out to be only arbitrary, savage, dull of passion. This one turns out to be only a despot, not a free man. Only the Greeks had an awareness of freedom, and therefore they were free, but they, like the Romans, only knew that some are free, not man as such; not even Plato and Aristotle knew this. So not only did the Greeks have slaves with whom their life and freedom were bound, but this freedom itself was in part an accidental, short-lived and limited flower. Only the Germanic peoples, Hegel believes, reached in Christianity the consciousness that man as such is free, that the freedom of the spirit constitutes the most basic property of his nature.</p>

        <p>Speaking of the role of the individual in history, Hegel points to their contribution to the world spirit. But individuals can act selfishly to the detriment of the goals of the world spirit. In this context Hegel puts forward the position of the &#39;artifice of reason in history&#39;, which acts as a connecting link between the necessity of the spirit and the arbitrariness of the individual. &quot;The artifice of reason&quot; forces people to take the road of freedom, and, to achieve this goal, can also sacrifice outstanding personalities: &quot;when the goal is reached, they fall away like an empty shell of grain&quot;.</p>

        <p>Hegel&#39;s philosophical system is completed by the doctrine of the absolute spirit, whose three stages are art, religion and philosophy. The final stage of Hegel&#39;s system is philosophy. Here lies the &#39;absolute endpoint&#39; of the self-development of the spirit; Hegel&#39;s doctrine is the end of the road. It must be said that Hegel was less inclined to attribute the merit of gaining absolute truth to his genius: &#39;What in my books belongs to me personally is mistaken&#39;. In his philosophy he saw only the last, concluding stage of a long journey of self-knowledge of the spirit, as if the final chapter in a collective work.</p>

        <p>The history of philosophy is the path to truth. Each system of philosophy emerged with necessity and with the same necessity gave way to another. It happens, it is true, observes Hegel, that a new philosophical doctrine emerges with the pretence of a complete refutation of all that preceded it and the acquisition of truth. But, according to previous experience, the system of philosophy which will refute and supplant it will not be long in coming. For himself, however, Hegel makes an exception. No system disappears without a trace, it continues to exist in a &#39;stripped down&#39; form, i.e. every subsequent stage in the development of philosophy not only follows from the previous one, but also absorbs everything valuable contained in it.</p>

        <p>Hegel is a panglogist. History ultimately represents the realisation of reason. &quot;To comprehend what is, that is the task of philosophy. For what is, is reason.&quot; &quot;What is reasonable is valid, and what is valid is reasonable&quot; is his main thesis.</p>

        <p><strong>Feuerbach&#39;s anthropological materialism.</strong>&nbsp; As a young man, <strong>L. Feuerbach (1804-1872)</strong> was a follower of Hegelian idealism, but after the publication in 1839 of &quot;For a Critique of Hegel&#39;s Philosophy&quot;, he switched to materialism. However, the main subject of his thoughts was philosophy of religion. In 1841 Feuerbach&#39;s work &quot;Essence of Christianity&quot; was published, which caused a wide resonance among German university youth. Feuerbach continued the line of freethinking begun by Xenophanes in the antiquity era - man creates God in his own image and likeness. Feuerbach&#39;s intention was to show: what we call theology is actually an anthropological reality. In other words, we ascribe to an imaginary, fictitious supreme being called God those qualities and properties that belong to man himself. He takes all the best qualities from himself and ascribes them to God. The central role is played here by love: &quot;Love is God himself, and outside love there is no God. Love makes man a god and God a man.&nbsp; According to Feuerbach, man&#39;s god is what his thoughts and intentions are. &quot;The value of god is not greater than that of man. The consciousness of god is the self-consciousness of man, the knowledge of god is the self-consciousness of man.&quot; Therefore Feuerbach concludes his book with the slogan &quot;Man to man is God&quot;. By man-god he does not mean individual man, but the human race, humanity as a whole. It possesses to an infinite degree the wisdom, justice, power, holiness which we have hitherto projected onto God. It is with humanity that we must cooperate in order to realise ourselves and not alienate ourselves in fantasy fiction. Therefore, in order to be human, one must renounce the transcendent God. Only man is the creator of man.</p>

        <p>Feuerbach&#39;s important place in the history of anthropology is explained by the fact that he discovered the Other, discovered the relation I - You as necessary for the realisation of the individual. Communication, communication, the relation of love constitute the essential elements of personal being. &quot;Being is community; being-for-itself is alienation and lack of communicativeness.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The essence of man consists only in community, in communication between man and man.&quot; Feuerbach is usually regarded as one of the originators of personalism.</p>

        <p>Historical conditions, theoretical sources, natural-scientific prerequisites for the emergence of Marxist philosophy. Marxist materialistic dialectics. Marxist philosophy of history. Established by <strong>K. Marx (1818-1883)</strong> and <strong>F. Engels (1820-1895),</strong> the scientific theory was a natural continuation of the classical German philosophy, and in particular of Hegel&#39;s idealistic dialectics, recycled on the materialistic basis of English political economy (A. Smith and D. Ricardo) and French utopian socialism (Ch. Fourier, A. Saint-Simon and R. Owen).</p>

        <p>Marx and Engels had a high regard for their predecessors, especially the philosophy of Hegel. They regarded themselves as disciples of Hegel, but already in their first two joint works (&quot;The Holy Family&quot; and &quot;German Ideology&quot;) they came out as critics of Hegelianism, because Hegelian philosophy had an abstract, speculative character; it was not about the development of the real world, but about some absolute idea. For Hegel, man appears only as an abstraction of man, his self-consciousness.</p>

        <p>Marx and Engels borrowed everything valuable from Hegel&#39;s philosophy, above all dialectics, which viewed all natural and social processes in development and change. Marx&#39;s critique of Hegel was based on the assertion of a new thesis: it is not consciousness that determines life, but life that determines consciousness. Legal and political institutions cannot be explained either from themselves or from the development of the spirit. They are the result of the development of the material conditions of society.</p>

        <p>Marx and Engels studied and philosophised the achievements of modern nineteenth century natural science, such as the discovery of cellular structure, Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the law of conservation and transformation of energy, etc.</p>

        <p>Marx was at one time a follower of Feuerbach, like all the Young Hegelians. Moreover, it was his reading of Feuerbach that determined his transition from Hegelian idealism to materialism. From 1884 he took up the study of political economy and evolved from moralising humanism to scientific economism. In brief, for Marx, man is a material being, part of material nature. He is born of it, lives in labour relations with it and becomes a man; he returns to it after death. Material nature is the inorganic body of man, writes Marx in his 1844 Manuscripts. Hence the importance of industry as a science of nature, as well as economics, which determines the relationship between man and nature and man and man. For the essence of man, from Marx&#39;s point of view, is a set of social relations, social relations in the nearest perspective being economic relations of production and exchange. The individual is seen as an element of the functioning of the economy and is determined by it. The economy represents the social basis that determines the superstructure, that is, the entire complex of political, legal, artistic, philosophical, religious, and moral realities that necessarily shape the essence of man and his behavior.</p>

        <p>The formation of the method of materialist dialectics took place first and foremost in Marx&#39;s Capital. The dialectical movement of the economic categories from the abstract to the concrete leads to a critical analysis of his contemporary state of bourgeois society and to the revolutionary conclusion about the need to &quot;expropriate the expropriators&quot;, i.e. to eliminate the private property of the exploiting classes by seizing the means of production from the owners (exploiters) in a forced way and transfer them into the property of the workers.</p>

        <p>Thus, dialectics acts both as a theory and as a methodology of cognition of society. Marxist dialectics formulates the principles of a dialectical view of the world: development, universal interrelationship, causality. We should clearly realize that the fundamental difference between the Marxist materialist dialectics and the Hegelian dialectics is as follows: in Marxism, the dialectics is the method of reproducing reality, while in Hegel&#39;s system, thought (absolute idea) generates the object itself, and, correspondingly, the dialectics acts as a self-development of the concept.</p>

        <p>&quot;The philosophers,&quot; said Marx, &quot;have only explained the world in various ways, but the task is to change it. Marx was close to the pathos of the Renaissance, which put man in the place of God. According to Marx, by changing the world, man changes himself, that is, he creates himself in the course of history. In a communist society, Marx believed, human prehistory would end and true history would begin.</p>

        <p>In any case, Marx did not see man as an individual, but as a member of a species, a social and communal being. It is capable of self-realisation only as a generic being, and the human race as a whole has more value than the individual. Society acts as a mediator between man and nature. The way to the fulfilment and liberation of man is practice. By practice, Marx meant any activity directed towards nature (first of all activities for the production of material goods), or revolutionary activity directed towards society so as to transform it into a classless society. For man, this dual practice serves as the ultimate criterion of truth and morality.</p>

        <p>The materialist understanding of history, set out in the preface to Marx&#39;s work &quot;Towards a Critique of Political Economy&quot;, had a significant impact on the philosophy of history and social life in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this work, Marx sees the development of society as a natural-historical process occurring independently of the mind and will of men. He argues that the basis of social life is material production, which ultimately determines the entire spiritual life of society. Marx concludes that it is not the consciousness of people that determines their existence, but on the contrary, social existence determines their consciousness. The engine of social progress, Marx believed, was the social revolution, which inevitably arises as a result of the contradictions between the productive forces and the productive relations of society. It is important to keep in mind that the founders of Marxism viewed social revolution as the engine of history.</p>

        <p>The most important categories of the materialist understanding of history are the concepts of &quot;basis and superstructure&quot;. In social life, according to Marx, people enter into certain, necessary, independent of their will relations - production relations, which correspond to a certain stage of development of their material productive forces. The totality of these production relations constitutes the economic structure of society, its basis, on which the legal and political superstructure rises and to which certain forms of social consciousness correspond. Besides the concept of economic basis of society, which is considered as a totality of production relations, Marx formulates the concept of mode of production that represents the unity of productive forces and production relations. The mode of production, the founders of Marxism conclude, determines the social, political and spiritual life of society. In its turn, the economic basis, or economic structure of society, determines both the nature of the mode of production itself and the essential features of all social phenomena and the way of life of people at a given stage of social development.</p>

        <p>However, the historical practice has shown the fallacy of absolutization of the role of economic basis. National traditions, character of religious beliefs, interaction and struggle of various socio-political structures make serious adjustments in the nature and direction of historical progress of various peoples.</p>

        <p>In the above-mentioned work (&quot;Towards a Critique of Political Economy&quot;), Marx uses and formulates the concept of socio-economic formation for the first time. By socio-economic formation Marx understands the type of society which is on a certain stage of development and has its own mode of production, its own basus and superstructure. This concept reflects a concrete-historical type of society, which is at the same time a stage, a stage of historical progress of mankind.</p>

        <p>Alas, the objective course of history and practice showed the failure of the formational approach of the founders of Marxism. Contrary to Marx&#39;s prophecy, the phantom dream of the homeless and destitute throughout their &quot;prehistory&quot; - communism as their true history - never came true.</p>

        <p>Marxist philosophy in Russia. The doctrine of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was known in Russia as early as the mid-1950s. Sufficed to say that the first translation of &quot;Capital&quot; into a foreign language was made in Russia. Representatives of Russian revolutionary democracy spread the ideas of Marxism in Russia. The first Russian Marxist was <strong>G.V. Plekhanov (1856-1918),</strong> who played an important role in disseminating and correctly perceiving ideas of the founders of Marxism. He substantiated and popularised the doctrine of Marxism, developed and elaborated its individual questions, especially in the field of social philosophy: on the role of the masses and the individual in history, on the interaction of the basics and superstructure, on the role of ideology, etc. The key to revealing the essence of social phenomena, according to Plekhanov, must be sought not in the nature of the individual individuals, but in the relations they enter into in the process of production.</p>

        <p>The further development of Marxist ideas is associated with <strong>Lenin (1870-1924)</strong>. In his work &quot;What are the friends of the people and how do they fight against the Social-Democrats?&quot; Lenin criticises the views of the liberal Narodniks and reveals the essence of the revolutionary revolution in philosophy by Marx and Engels. Criticism of non-Marxist philosophy occupies a considerable place in Lenin&#39;s philosophical work, which is carried out in Materialism and Empiriocriticism, Philosophical Notebooks and a number of other works and articles.</p>

        <p>However, Lenin, as the organizer and leader of the Bolshevik Social Democratic Party of Russia and a professional revolutionary, focused primarily on the idea of the class struggle and the mechanisms for implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this connection it is worth paying attention to the departure of Lenin and his followers during the period of &quot;war communism&quot; from a materialist understanding of history and their shift to a subjective interpretation of certain Marxist positions on the possibility of building a communist society in an economically backward country like Russia, a country that had just embarked on the capitalist path of development. Although, as noted above, many provisions of Marx and Engels&#39; teachings were subsequently rejected by actual historical practice.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that &quot;Marxist philosophy&quot; and &quot;Soviet philosophy&quot; are not identical. Of course, Marxism became the dominant worldview in the Soviet Union because it was in the arsenal of the Communist Party and was used to ideologically justify the political regime that existed for several decades.</p>

        <p>However, rewriting history, crossing out the most important achievements of the Soviet period, in particular the one that opened access to education for millions of children from working and peasant families, and much more, represented the other extreme. It is no coincidence that the appeal &quot;October for Us, Russia and the World&quot;, circulated on the eve of the 90th anniversary of the October Revolution by well-known Russian scientists - specialists in various fields of knowledge - expressed alarm at the hasty dismantling of the achievements of the Soviet era. &quot;The fall of the Soviet model of society does not mean that the ideals of October are false. Just as Christian ideas are not responsible for the practices of the Inquisition, so Stalinist totalitarianism does not destroy the ideals of the revolution,&quot; the appeal reads. Just as Lenin had once defended the achievements of pre-revolutionary Russia in science, literature, art, etc., against the vulgar materialists who demanded that even Pushkin be &quot;thrown overboard&quot; as a representative of bourgeois culture, so today&#39;s generation is required to take maximum responsibility for the achievements of the Soviet period. Just as socialist culture was not built &quot;in an empty place&quot;, enriching itself with the achievements of mankind of the preceding period, so too should post-Soviet Russia show the utmost respect for the gains of Soviet culture.</p>

        <p>Within dialectical-materialist philosophy, there was also another school of thought that was in closed opposition to the process of the politicization of philosophy and oriented toward scientific and humanistic thought. This direction was represented by <strong>V.F. Asmus (1894-1975), B.M. Kedrov (190 -1985), E.V. Ilyenkov (1924 - 1979), P.V. Kopnin (1922 - 1971)</strong> and others.</p>
